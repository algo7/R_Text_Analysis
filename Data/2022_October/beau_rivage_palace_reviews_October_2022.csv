Incredible - perfect,"We have traveled internationally many places in fine hotels; this hotel was of gréât delight. It was friendly yet respectful. Quite beautiful, yet not imposing. It was impeccably clean. This is a refined experience that was a delight. The Olympic Games museum is very near, a delightful walking promenade next to the lake is immediately accessible from the hotel. There were several restaurants which we enjoyed. The food in the Cafe beau-rivage was special and well done. Enjoy!",
Outstanding stay at this jewel of a hotel.,"Beautiful hotel in a gorgeous setting. Outstanding accommodations with warm and attentive staff always ready to answer your questions, provide information about the surrounding area and address your needs. Pool facilities are outstanding. The location is beside the Olympic Museum and a lovely drive along Lake Geneva to other attractions of the area (highly recommend a wine walk / tour and Charlie Chaplin’s Museum). The hotel is a short walk to a metro to the main town.",
Ultimate Swissness,"An unforgettable experience in a quiet and refined environment. What a romantic retreat with delicate and discrete staff, breathtaking views on the Leman Lake and Alps mountains. Fully renovated and well maintained Hotel with great Spa and swimming pools. The highlight was definitely the Michelin star restaurant (Anne-Sophie Pic@BRP). We ll be back for sure",
Paradise in Switzerland,"Just left the Beau Rivage on our first trip to Switzerland. The room was fabulous and the view was one of the best we ever had. The service and staff were very helpful on taking care of all our needs, and planning all our activities. Unfortunately it was raining a lot so we couldn’t play golf but we’re able to change all our plans easily. The location is perfect as you can pick up the boat right next door or jump on the Metro to go into Laussane. Breakfast was great and I would highly recommend staying there, it doesn’t get much better.",
5 stars palace well deserved,"Faultless as usual , outstanding for everything. From the staff to the spa, the outdoor bar. Just a tiny bit disappointed by the Japanese restaurant that used to be a bit better but just to be picky. Otherwise a true palace in an outstanding building",
"Excellent, but far from perfect","We had a memorable stay in a lovely hotel. The quality of the decor matches the well executed blend of old and new in the two parts of the hotel. And our bedroom was lovely, restful and well equipped (though the shower unit was old, tired and in need of upgrading). The spa at first sight looks wonderful as do changing rooms and surrounding areas. But, they are not well looked after. For example, the men's steam room is suffers from two big flaws - the upper level is not hot and the lower level is not even warm. And, the few staff were absent and therefore were not available to help guests around the outdoor pool area snd in the ladies' changing rooms and surrounding areas the floors had been allowed to remain wet and slippery, and this led to an unfortunate accident. Our",
une expérience exceptionnelle,"Nothing will ever match the emotional intensity I felt of being surrounded by my favourite restaurant staff at the Cafe Beau Rivage last summer and discovering that the magical ingredients of efficient charm and fabulous cooking was intact untrammelled by the events of 2020. Nevertheless my experience this year was, unbelieveably, better. From the moment of my check in by the delightfull young lady to the the gracious young man who provided water as I began my onward journey and everyone in between I was once again taken by the Beau Rivage Embrace. Politeness and respect are etched in to the teams DNA. This time I used the spa for treatments. The environment is state of art offering quiet tranquilty before you even start your journey, Beau Rivage have wisely invested",
Perfection,"If there is a better hotel to stay in for a vacation, I haven't found it. The Beau-Rivage Palace was perfection. The friendly staff, wonderful concierge service (hello Sylvie), delicious restaurants, beautiful room with wicker furniture on our lanai overlooking the lake and the French Alps. We chose the Palace side rooms, taking a Junior Suite with cream painted walls a lovely fruit plate that was refreshed every day, not to mention the champagne. Big beautiful bathroom. And the views from the room on the 4th floor were stupendous. We ate at both the Japanese restaurant (lovely alternatives to sushi--tempura shrimp, black cod with stir fried vegetables, as well as the French cafe with a fabulous choice, including crabmeat stuffed zucchini flowers which I had to have twice",
Beautiful and comfortable!,Beautiful and comfortable hotel in a wonderful setting in front of Lake Leman in Lausanne. We appreciated the pool facilities and Spa. Courteous staff and amazing suites. We suggest including a coffeemaker in the room. World class restaurants and very well maintained gardens and structure. We will definitively come again!,
First class hotal,"This was the best hotel that i have experienced. The location was fabulous on Lake Geneva. We quickly realized that if we thought something was missing from the room that we just needed to look a little bit further. We did not have adapters for the J electric plugs but sure enough, they were in the desk drawer. The decor is classy but not in your face and is just plain inviting. The service was second to none. We needed some bubble wrap for some gifts and they gave it to us in record time. We used Lausanne as a jumping off point to visit Evian, Geneva, Annecy. After a lot of sightseeing, we came back to the infinity pool in the evening around seven. From the pool, you can see the mountains painted by the sun as it goes down. The lounges near the pool are so comfortable.",
One of the best hotels is the world,"Spectacular views, historic building greatly refurbished rooms with taste, large choice of restaurants. The gril and the café are fantastic. Allen the concierge is very experienced and helpful. Many places in the are to visit vineyards, Montreux, Geneva",
Fabulous hotel,"What a spectacular hotel - the rooms have every imaginable luxury - the beds and their comforters are super comfortable- the rooms are always being restocked with fresh flower arrangements. Kind and attentive staff, great spa, modern fully equipped exercise room, wonderful breakfast buffet. Sushi restaurant on property was our favorite.",
Fantastic,Great hotel with fantastic service. From the arrival to the departure the experience was just perfect. The facilities themselves are very well maintained and the overall feeling is just great. A true gem of Swiss hospitality which makes you feel both on holiday and home away from home.,
Wedding Anniversary,"We have stayed for two days and loved everything: the beautiful location, the room service, the breakfast buffet, the Spa. All the staff has been very kind. They made our Wedding Anniversary really special. Thank you very much for your effort and kindness.",
Beau Rivage Palace — a luxurious stay overlooking beautiful Lake Geneva and the mountains,"My room was spacious, beautiful and so comfortable. I loved the closet space and the big bathroom with double sink, separate bathtub and shower with aromatherapy pods, and the toilet space with frosted glass door to separate it from the rest of the bathroom. And the large bathroom mirror with built in television screen was fabulous! Staff is friendly and so helpful and room service and housekeeping great. Everything was perfect. I wish I could have stayed longer.",
Horrible stay,"Room is terrible , no bed sheets, curtains which let the outside lights, terrible night. I don’t understand the value proposition of this hotel . Garden and terrace are nice but for the price you pay … it is not understandable that you don’t have the basic of hospitality",
"Tranquil, Private and very pleasant staff","Fantastic service, amazing hotel on huge grounds. Staff are very friendly and always helpful. Breakfast is in a large area with great views of the lake. It was raining so could not sit on the terrace. Very private hotel which is nice. I would stay here again",
Hospitality like you would like to offer your guests at home!,"I once more stayed at the Beau Rivage and like every time before, it was a grandiose expereince starting with the welcoming by name by the porter at the entrance to a smooth check in and the perfect room with fresh flowers and a great view across the lake. Food for dinner parallels the quality and finesse of the accomodation. ",
Our first and most definitely not our last stay,"A first class experience which you pay for but they deliver in spade fulls. Excellent reception desk, helpful and friendly personnel. Friendly door men. Lovely room, a deluxe with lake view. Well maintained, excellent housekeeping, beautiful lake views, small balcony- lovely. Another mention of reception who were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable when I ran into problems on our last day, trying to submit the UK passenger locator form. They solved the problem, thank you! We dined in the Beau Rivage Cafe, lovely food, professional service, pleasant ambiance. We also had drinks on a number of occasions in the main bar where the staff were quite excellent. I have nothing but praise for this hotel. Thank you for a lovely stay.",
Exceptional,"This is a true 5 star hotel . In fact , I have been to a few 5 stars hotel in my life but I have never lived such magical experience. It was a budget for us that we don’t regret as we will remember this time fondly . Everything was faultless and beyond any expectations we had .",
The palace experience,"Entering you feel immediately as though you are royalty, the palace is beautiful and the decorations are stunning, especially at Christmas. Thé breakfast was delightful, the lake view gorgeous, the beds extremely comfortable and many well thought-out activities for kids. I highly recommend a visit here.",
Our #1 hotel in French speaking Switzerland,Our favourite hotel in all of French Speaking Switzerland. This is now a third trip here and every occasion is magical. It’s a haven of peace and calm. Head to the CAFE and Qamil Will ensure you have a memorable experience. He even remembers from a trip eight months ago! You can’t teach this sort of attention to detail. It comes from passion. Amazing beef tartare and fillets de perche from the lake. The lounge is also a great place to hang out for a cocktail and if you have the occasion this winter do go out into the champagne tent. We’ve done at Ana Sophie Pic twice previously and considering perhaps the best restaurants we visited on Earth and we have been to 11 Madison. On this occasion we couldn’t eat at Anne-Sophie as it was closed due to several staff getting,
It is the best!,"Very good but a little old fashioned.so my rating is: excellent here is more stuff from me: you guys could add more food to the buffet!! also add some tech like radios, and all of that. your hotel is very good oh and more security my father’s phone got stolen and it is a iPhone 13 pro max!!!",
It doesn’t get better,"I’ve been coming to the hotel for 45 years (!!!) and while many hotels have fallen in terms of service, the Beau Rivage stands out for still maintaining its old world service! From arrival to departure, every care is provided. The rooms of the lake are calming, the concierge, Alllan, can make everything possible with no challenge too big. This has been a home away from home for me when I come to Switzerland, and it remains so. The rooms are smalls but very well done, with lovely bathrooms. The only thing missing is they stopped putting a piece of Swiss chocolate on your pillow during turndown service. A wonderful location on the lake that is the most special party of Lausanne, and 3 minutes from the city center either by taxi or the tram which is a 2 minute walk away (and super",
A bit rusty at the palace.,"This is the first time that I was disappointed at this property. Unbeknownst to us, the hotel is in construction. Half of the rooms, original lobby, gift shop are not available. Room prices are higher than we have ever paid. In our experience staff in a leading hotel of the world have always been proficient in English. I had problems communicating in French in the breakfast room, room service, the pool are and the spa. Our room was above the service entrance and starting very early in the morning we could hear trucks making deliveries. For a room price of SF 780.00 I do not expect these annoyances. The plus side to our experience was the beautiful gardens and the sparkling pool. The location could not be better for walks along the lake.",
A Perfect Marriage of Superb Execution & Charming Service.,"To return to the Beau Rivage after an absence of two years and experience the same perfect blend of efficient service, exquisite food offerings in elegant surroundings warms the heart. Indeed the food offerings had moved up a notch and were that much more powerful and exciting. What makes the Beau Rivage special though is a simple human trait. It is the provision of hospitality with the perfect blend of charm, sophistication and good manners and whether it is the increasing use of technology or health care protocols that essence of the place is never distilled or reduced or diverted as a result of current circumstances whatever they maybe. As I grow older I value the experience more than ever and I feel sure that when I return those qualities which are written into the DNA",
Paradise in Switzerland,"Due to Corona we (from Switzerland) decided…not to go to Ibiza…not to fly to Sardinia this year…but to spend some days at the Beau Rivage in Lausanne. And it was beautiful!!!! Off topic at the beginning of this review: we felt very very save all the time, they really do as much as possible to avoid ANY SARS-COV2 infection. I am a doctor and by my profession maybe a bit more critical than the average visitor and felt save all the time. We experienced a very warm welcome at check-in. Beautiful room, quiet, a dream. I really must say, all the stuff we met was so friendly, there was no second we did not feel like in paradise. Breakfast was amazing, dinner at the Japanese restaurant, pool, garden, lounge, really nothing to complain. Thank you very much for the most beautiful days me",
Wonderful Anniversary Stay,"When you go to a hotel of the quality and reputation of the Beau-Rivage Palace, you expect a good experience and good service. Therefore it takes something special for one’s expectations to be exceeded. But certainly they were. From the magnificence of the exterior of the building to the sumptuous decor inside, the visual aspect of the hotel is wonderful together with the mature picturesque gardens with the outlook to the lake. The actual room was very tastefully decorated and furnished which provided a very comfortable stay. The spa area too is a very relaxing and well equipped sanctuary from the bustle of life. On top of this the cuisine in both the Anne-Sophie Pic restaurant and the Japanese Miyako was outstanding and being able to watch the Teppanyaki chefs prepare the food",
Fabulous,"From A-Z this place is just fab. Front desk- so welcoming and efficient. Junior suite: among best I have ever seen. Service: wherever you go, people are just wonderful. Breakfast: outstanding. Property is beautiful, lovely outdoor pool. Gym: perfect. We will be back. ",
Wonderful place!,"This wonderful hotel is located on the shore of the lake in an absolutely beautiful landscape. We spent much time at the pool which is the best you can imagine. Food is just wonderful. Everything is well cared for and exactly what you would expect from this type of hotel. There is however, s significant draw-back: We were there in mid September for 2 nights. We were in the middle of a strong rise of corona-infections. Lausanne was at the center of a coronavirus-hotspot in Switerzland. And still, there was an open, unprotected breakfast buffet. In theory, everybody had to wear a mask. However, most guest forgot about that and served themselves, some of them sneezing and coughing. Personell is trained to be polite. Unfortunately, they are not trained to enforce hygienic measures.",
very relaxing short trip,very attentive staff that was very helpful throughout our stay. the amenities were in an immaculate state. The room was very clean and tastefully decorated Everything in the room including shower etc functioned as new ,
One of the best hotels in the world,"We stayed here in Jan 2020 for a couple of days as we embarked on a train tour around Switzerland. From the moment we stepped into the hotel, we were awestruck by the history of the place. The view was amazing, the room was very bright and airy, and the hospitality of all the staff truly set the hotel apart from others. Romina and Neva put smiles on our faces and remembered our preferences for coffee and breakfast in the mornings. We enjoyed our stay at the Beau-rivage Palace, and our only regret is that we didn't have the opportunity to stay longer!",
Excellent stay with very personalised service!,The best Hotel in Lausanne. We had our wedding night at the BRP and as we had stayed there before we knew it was the right hotel for the most special day. We were not disappointed. Thank you to all the hotel staff for an unforgettable experience!,
An oasis in an otherwise already beautiful region!,"How could you not give this hotel the very to rating? We stayed in a large junior suite with lake view and the weather was beautiful. This historic hotel must have been fully renovated not too many years ago. All the public areas are sublime and grand. A grand hotel in the truest sense of the word. The breakfast room is huge and the buffet perfectly set up and presented. We ate at three restaurants in the hotel during our stay (see my other reviews) and although service was impeccable at the Michelin starred restaurant, it was inadequate at the other two places. Still no reason to rate the hotel with anything less that with 5 points. It must be said that due to its pricing, the hotel caters first and foremost to an elitist crowd of which I am happy to say we are not part of. ",
Sets the standard - apart from breakfast,"Sublime stay during August at this lovely Swiss hotel on the shores of Lake Geneva. Clean, comfortable rooms, more pillows and towels than two people could possibly need contribute to the feeling of luxury and well being. Cafe Beau Rivage has an excellent and varied menu and should have a Michelin star. The only downside, in my opinion, was breakfast. Prior to Covid 19 it was mainly buffet with a served egg menu. Now some of the fruit is still help yourself and although some of it was laid out cling filmed, a lot of it wasn’t. The bread basket prior to Covid was placed on individual tables but now, totally inexplicably, is laid out buffet style. Surely a danger? This should be rethought and rearranged.",
It doesn't get much better than this...,"Such a delight to see how the Management has succeeded in making a traditional hotel into somewhere that fits modern times. We were expecting to stay in the 'Grand Hotel Budapest' but could not have been more wrong The rooms are spotlessly clean; staff understand the requirements of their guests and could not have been more helpful; the food is top notch. All in all, one of the finest hotels in Switzerland and a credit to the Management and owners",
wonderful,"one of the most beautiful hotels in the world. we had a perfect junior suite with lake view. pool area was a bit crowded due to the great weather but service was perfect. spa is amazing, too. only minus was that the breakfastcrew seems to prefer outside guests over houseguests as they offer them the best (available) tables on the terrasse while houseguests were shown tables in the windy inside.",
Fine feathers do not always make fine birds!,"This Grand Hotel of great history, that I used to visit years ago , seems to be sleeping on the glorious of the past! Bad service and mismanagement unfortunately encountered on many parts of the hotel. Here only two of them lived a day ago: Several seats were available at the garden terrace facing the lobby. 3 friendly people sitting there invited me to their table and to take one of the armchairs next to them, which I did . Comes the waitress asking if I was with these 3 people, which of course I denied being alone. Here upon the waitress argued that then she could not serve me as the management requests only one bill per table , even if like here there obviously were seats for minimum 6 personnes and we were 3 + 1. At this moment the 3 friendly persons argued not accepting",
Staff too busy to serve us the dessert part of afternoon tea,"In April 2019 we celebrated my son’s 1st birthday at this luxury hotel. We chose Beau Rivage because it’s the one place we frequently visited in the 1st year of my son’s life and we felt it symbolised a lot of the fun memories we’d had when we became a family of four. The frequent visits were to the spa where my other child took private swimming lessons each Saturday. So on the happy occassion of the birthday we booked a table for 6 (incl 2 children) for the afternoon tea menue. I had also specially ordered for a theme cake fir which I had exchanged several e-mails with the hotel staff. While the hotel itself is beautiful decor wise with an amazing view over lake Geneva, on this occassion I didn’t feel that the service matched the high-end ambience of the hotel. The staff was",
Ne plus ultra,"A very lovely stay - stellar property in 10 acres of private gardens, can-do staff without exception (special thanks to Christine, a future GM), spectacular restaurants (La Terrasse and Cafe Beau-Rivage were exemplary) and a wonderful sense of place and wellbeing. The additional flourishes for Christmas and the festive season (horse riding, carousel, marshmallow roasting) were rather nice. All eyes on the new leisure offering planned for later this year - there is the potential to make this unbeatable.",
BEST Breakfast Buffet in Lausanne!,"Healthy, delicious, variety and amazing breakfast items ever! The view while having breakfast is breathtaking!!!! The room is very spacious, super clean and loved the tv in the bathroom miror. what an experience...will never forget it! Can't wait to visit again :)",
Must be the world's best kept secret!,"The Hotel is absolutely outstanding! Everything about it oozes luxury and elegance, without a trace of ostentation! From the minute you walk into the Reception, you are seized by the splendour and beauty of this 5* property! The service, be it at the Front Desk or in the Restaurants, is courteous, friendly, discreet and attentive! The Miyako (Japanese) Restaurant is superb, the breakfast buffet at Café Beau-Rivage is bountiful, with plenty of fresh fruit, a delicious Birchermuesli, and hot dishes, which can also be ordered à-la-carte! As far as Rooms are concerned, I highly recommend paying the extra to have a Deluxe Room overlooking the Lake and the Alps or a Junior Suite with a balcony! The view is absolutely breathtaking! The Christmas decorations are stunning! A 2nd",
Memories for the rest of our lifes.,"Although we went to the Beau Rivage Palace for a conference it was also the birthday of my little daughter and the entire Team but especially the Reception made this day very memorable. The warm words, appreciation and always a smile for the little ones are making also the parents happy. Of course we enjoyed the beautiful Room very much and the breathtaking views! Unfortunatly Pool was closed, but there was a lot of other things to enjoy. Thank you",
Want to try a hotel that is more than 5 stars? This is it.,"Many grand older hotels in Europe look a bit shabby and tired. Too much public space to maintain, to much garden. They cannot keep it all up. Not this hotel. It is in superb condition. We had a lake view room with a balcony, essential. In the new wing which I think is preferable. The bathroom was big, beautiful and the whole room blended a traditional look with lots of fun electronics including a second TV in the bathroom mirror. Breakfast was excellent. I was there for the world triathlon championships and kept my bike in the room and wheeled it out each day through the fancy lobby. No complaints. Staff were super attentive and REALLY helpful. nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is full of historical photos and shows how the rich and famous stayed there and important",
World Class Hotel,"Wife and I stayed here in July, and I highly recommend it. It kind of reminds me of a European version of the Four Seasons in Austin, which is my favorite American hotel, in that it has a sprawling backyard and pool area overlooking the lake. A lot of hotels like this will have the grand palace facade but lack modern amenities and comforts--this one was clearly renovated recently and does not suffer from that. We had a lake view king, and it was well worth the upgrade.",
Definition of Swiss Hotel Perfection!,This has to be one of our all time favorite hotels in the world . We go back every year and it never fails. THe service is extremely professional efficient and very friendly. The hotel oozes with quality and 1st class all the way. All the restaurants and bars are amazing and you will be spoilt for choice. Amazing breakfast... just watch out for the birds! Top pick is the female chef 2 star Michelin Anne Sophie PIC. The Brasserie is super ! The Japanese restaurant is very authentic and the black cod here is better than Nobu. The bar has the best trained baristas serving the best cocktails. The pool and garden is spectacular. Just one comment and advice to the management that the spa (cinque monde) is well over due for a full renovation and expansion. It’s very tired and not,
Everything a Top Hotel Should Be -- And More!,"The Beau Rivage Palace is a beautiful old-world hotel at the edge of Lac Leman in the Ouchy section of Lausanne. The views of the lake and Alps are stunning and what make the location special, so even though those rooms are more costly, they are worth it. Once you're paying this much for a hotel, just splurge a bit more for the view. Our room oozed sophisticated elegance and the huge bathroom with its vaulted ceiling, perfect lighting and mirrors everywhere was truly beautiful. But the piece de resistance was the sliding doors above the bathtub that opened to look across the room, out the balcony and at the Alps! Housekeeping was impeccable and the service overall is as top notch as the location. Everyone from the woman that took our reservation originally (and put up with",
Almost impossible to find fault with the Palace,"To find fault is very difficult...but I managed...the mirror steams up in the bath room if you run your Jacuzzi tub too long! The solution would be heating a small segment of the mirror to keep it clear. The Reception will provide complimentary passes for the Metro & buses. We took the Metro up 7 stops to the Old Town of a look-about and walked back down. Not for the faint-of-wallet so enjoy your stay, you deserve it.",
Top chick and elegance there,"Reception and all ground level looks like kings palace.Rooms are elegantly and tastefully decorated. Unless this hotel was built 1861, newest electronics and bath equipment are installed. Impeccable cleanness everywhere. Breakfast buffet is rich and service personnel very efficient. Well, prices are very high , but it is worth to stay in this top quality hotel",
Trip to Switzerland,"We have stayed three nights in September 2019 and it was our second stay with this hotel. I don’t want to go into details and will say it shortly: hotel is absolutely wonderful in terms of location, facilities and service. Without any doubt it is the best hotel in the beautiful city of Lausanne.",
Luxury on the Lake,My family has traveled extensively throughout Europe and we typically stay at luxury hotels. This one did not disappoint! From the moment we arrived at this gorgeous hotel until the moment we left we felt pampered. The service at check-in was warm and informative. Our room (lakefront) was enormous. The bed was so comfortable we did not want to leave. The fitness center is large and well-equipped. The pool is gorgeous with a view of the lake and drinks service. We ate dinner and lunch here and the service was impeccable. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Lausanne.,
Wonderful Concierge,We stayed 6 nights at this hotel during the World Triathlon Olympic distance championships. The hotel was wonderful and perfectly located for all the racing activity as well as for catching a boat ride around to different towns along Lake Léman with rail connections from there to beautiful alpine areas of Switzerland. While there we had a miscommunication with housekeeping due to the mini fridge not really being cold enough for my wife’s eye medication and we having to keep it in a bucket of ice which they took away along with all the medication. Fortunately Alan our concierge worked diligently to help us find a pharmacy and get the meds replaced. Alan was more than helpful at every turn. He turned what could have been a very bad experience into a good memory. Hotels are only as,
Intimate wedding ceremony,"I’ll like to thanks Mathias & his team to make our wedding ceremony very nice & special. Not only place is amazing, really appropriate for this type of event, quality of diner as expected, team was also professional & so kind they succeeded to found music for diner getting speaker from others waiters. Big thanks to all the team for this great moment. Jérôme ",
Nice gardens! But it left me with a bitter taste...,"I stayed here in August 2019 for two nights in a superior room. The main reason to stay here was due their nice outdoor pool area compared to e.g. the Lausanne Palace or other hotels I looked at before my booking. As I've asked for a balcony they upgraded me to a partly lake view, which was highly appreciated. However, it was a bit strange that the access to my room, which was on the 6th floor, was by accessing an emergency exit door on the 5th floor to take the steps from their. There would also have been an elevator on the emergency exit staircase, but it was out of order on the second day of my stay. The hotel has an impressive history and it is a very fine house. As it is so huge it is a huge undertaking to keep everything in order. They try hard, but there are still some",
Spectacular Hotel and Superb Service!,"We have traveled the world and we can report that the Beau Rivage is a very special place. From the moment you walk in the lobby, you are treated as if you are the only guest by the remarkable staff. I could write a short story about the hotel's fantastic amenities, it's wonderful restaurants, or our luxurious lake view room, but instead I am going to focus on the hotels' amazing concierge staff. Without question, the concierge team were the most knowledgeable, helpful and kind people that we have experienced in 50 years of travel. They happily arranged for luxury cars to be delivered to the hotel for our day trips to Annecy, Gruyere and the wine country. In every case, their service included easy directions, wonderful scenic stops, recommended wineries and fabulous",
"Location, Location, Location","The views are incomparable across Lake Geneva. The rooms in the remodeled side are spectactular. The service is also impressive. The food is a little pretentious, but it is Switzerland! The grounds are incredibly well maintained.",
Belle Époque Gem with Impeccable Service,"We stayed in a Junior Suite in the newly renovated Palace Wing. The living area and bedroom are comfortable and spacious with spectacular view of Lake Geneva. The architecture of the historic hotel is a Belle Époque gem in itself set in beautiful grounds. The service was impeccable. Food was excellent both at breakfast and the Cafe Beau-Rivage. Great spa with nice indoor and outdoor pool. Truly one of the best hotels in Switzerland, if not the world. ",
Went Once And Never Considered Another Hotel in Lausanne,"I have just returned from my third stay at the Beau-Rivage Palace Hotel. I had such a delightful experience the first time I went a second time which convinced me to go back a third dime and I now have no intention of even trying another hotel in Lausanne, although my friends have recommended others which they say are of a similar quality. The hotel is located right off the lake and if you get a lake view you'll see the mountains as well. Absolutely stunning. From the moment you arrive at this quiet tucked away place, you are greeted by friendly Bellmen. This continues at the Front Desk which check-in is always efficient. The foyer is comfortable with a high ceiling and a nice floral scent always pervades the hotel. There are many dining choices and I've tried them all. Each",
Amazing stay!,"We stayed here for the Montreux Jazz Festival in July 2019. We had a suite with direct view of Lake Geneva, the view is astonishing! The spa has everything you expect from a 5 star hotel and the service overall was quite pleasant. The location of the hotel is perfect to walk around Lausanne and a short train ride to Montreux. Highly recommended!",
Very Good- But Expensive,"I went there with my mum for a massage. Everything went great. The place is great, the staff is great. The pool is great. Although I did almost slip and die on the wet tile floor with my slippers, but I caught myself in time. Honestly, it was like a dream. The only two things that weren’t great were: 1. The price. I get that you get what you pay for, but I come on... 2. In the Pool, kids are allowed. Now, believe me, I have nothing against kids, but when you just wanna relax, they will make you do the opposite. And it’s cute, two toddlers playing with their mom and dad, but they should have a pool for families and a pool for people who wanna relax. And they should be able to do it with the money we pay them!",
An Oasis of zenitude and bliss!,"Must be Switzerland's best-kept secret! From the minute you set a foot in the Lobby to the minute you go down the steps of the Hotel's main entrance, you feel like ""royalty""! The exterior and interior of the 2-building Hotel are grand, part of the Swiss heritage, stylish or contemporary. The Hotel is set well away from the street below amongst a lush garden, with plants, flowerbeds and English lawns. The guestroom corridors of the new building are in shades of grey and pale purple. The Rooms facing the lake offer a stunning view of the Lake and mountains. The choice of Restaurants is enormous and caters to all tastes & all budgets: Anne-Sophie Pic (world famous & locally 2-star Michelin rated), Miyako (excellent Japanese food!), L'Accademia (Italian food at its best!), 57°",
Absolutely delightful,"We spent 4 nights on the 4th floor with Lake view room. Just gorgeous. The room was lovely and the brunch was fabulous. The decor and furnishings were superb. We loved all the amenities and the service was great. The complimentary electric boat was amazing. The chess, tennis and playground were fun to use.",
Terrible,"Checked in today, its like staying in a hostel with full or rules and regulations, sat in cafe beau rivage for juice the server said to please move to other restaurant as they only serve if you order something and told me to move to terrace despite having two rooms in the hotel, have travelled to best properties in the world never had such a terrible expirence, the funniest was spoke to concierge was somethings he told 1 or 2 things and then advised travel information of city would be able to guide you better.. Lol.. A total thumbs down",
What a building!,"I loved this hotel the moment I stepped into it. The building is just breathtaking and that’s before you start taking into account the views, which are spectacular. The staff are all very well trained and attentive without being overbearing. The bars, restaurants and grounds are all first class. It is by far the most relaxing hotel I’ve stayed in for a while. Loved it. ",
Brilliant place for stay or conference,"Although there for business conference, we found staff excellent, especially the concierge. He was able to arrange a car for us and argue on our behalf as the price quoted over the telephone was not the price when booked an hour later. Rooms were huge and food good, although the choice at Breakfast was good, not excellent, (see Bellagio at Lake Como for excellent). Go for Lake view as this will make a lot of difference. We did not try the Michigan starred restaurant but did eat at other places in the Hotel as well as other local restaurants as there was a good selection. Hotel spotless and high levels of staffing that all spoke good English. Great local walks along the lake for many miles. Large amusement and fun fair 1 mile up road and good facilities for younger children in",
Amazing hotel in an amazing location,"The entire place is a 'palace'! The building, decor, ceilings all have the wow factor. The rooms are immaculate, the food is excellent and the staff are extremely friendly. Although your stay at the hotel would be quite costly, its definitely a place to spoil yourself.",
Amazing palace,"Beautifully refurbished (great marble tastes and decorum), lovely garden and views... friendly staff, top food and good bars with terrasse ... Nice sport facilities (gym and tennis) and very relaxing spa. Quite hard to find any negative really (the key holder may be a bit heavy? The old elevator to go down to the spa may do with a refurbishment?)",
Great place,"Located in the most beautiful area of Lausanne, facing lake Geneva and the French/Swiss alps just across the lake. It’s a postcard view. The building is superb, both from the outside as well as inside. The food in the various restaurants is also top notch. The service has some room for improvement considering the context and the segment this hotel is positioned. Some of the personnel lack experience and the touch you’d expect in a top class/ top price hotel.",
Amazing experience!!,"All the bells and whistles at this luxury hotel. Combined with dedicated, discreet service. Rooms were spacious and beautifully maintained and any special requests were met quickly and with a smile. Would definitely return!!",
Beau- Rivage PALACE,"Stunning Hotel, friendly staff and fantastic location for both business and pleasure I had a wonderful experience at the Beau-Rivage Palace. Thank you for your warm welcome and prompt services, I will be returning with my family.",
Beautiful inside and out,5 star hotel that caters to all your needs. Our room was spacious and had a great view of the lake. Turn down bed service every night. the ONLY thing I could say they need is to get some USB outlets somewhere in the room.,
Business stay,"Part of a Corporate event. Stayed 4 nights Amazing location and views. The staff went above and beyond. Every detail is maintained and managed expertly. Strongly recommend. Bed like a dream, plenty of room and storage.",
Beau Rivage Beauty,"We spent a wonderful week at the Beau Rivage Palace and had an incredible time. The Hotel is amazing, staff were fantastic. They really pay attention to detail and go the extra mile to make your stay wonderful. We especially enjoyed Vivien, Athena and the other gentleman whose name escapes me. They really made each night special. Spending time letting us know about Lausanne and ideas on what to do. They make amazing cocktails and watching them craft each one was great. The Room Service staff and Housekeeping were superb. Thank you for your care. I have never had room service show up promptly with the food perfectly cooked and hot on time. Impeccable. Now for the view it is breathtaking! You cannot go wrong with a stay at Beau Rivage Palace. A true 5 star hotel! Oh say hello to",
A very beautiful place to stay and relax.,Visited for an exciting summit where over 400 global business leaders attended. The customer service experience was interesting . The hotel over looking the river is so beautiful . There is something about this hotel...smile.,
The Absolute Best,"I spent a few nights at this hotel recently as part of a group for a corporate event. This hotel is beyond 5 star. It is by far the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in, and I have stayed in some very beautiful hotels. Everything about this hotel is top notch. The service is award winning. It is well worth the money, in my opinion. The location and view of Lake Geneva is magnificent. I enjoyed every moment of my stay. ",
One of Europe’s Great Hotels,"This hotel, with it’s late 19th century grandeur, outstanding service, and beautiful grounds really gives you a feel for how old world European travel must have felt. We had a beautiful lake view room with balcony, fireplace, and couches. The location is perfect as well - a 5 min walk from the Ouchy Metro and across from the ferry terminal.",
Wonderful hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel situated on Lake Geneva. The rooms, although not large, are beautifully decorated with some very nice features. The bathroom is perfect. Although this hotel doesn’t come cheap, the enchanting view of the lake made the cost worthwhile. The staff in all areas were polite, helpful and couldn’t do enough for us. The breakfast choice is vast and served in a beautiful curved glass room. The location of the hotel is perfect for the Olympic museum and Metro. To be recommended for a special occasion or short break.",
Lovely place to stay and do business,Excellent service all round. Food was first rate. Beds were very comfortable and room was light and airy. The only thing needed in the room is a coffee machine. Internet quality was strong and gym although small was sufficient. ,
Exemplary service in a stunning setting,Aside form the stunning location and view of the property. The hotel is staffed across the board with friendly and competent people which really makes the hotel stand out. Think they've done a great job of maintaining the character of a beautiful old property and grounds while at the same modernising it enough to make sure is comfortable. ,
A can’t miss,"It lives up to its reputation. Beautiful expansive grounds on Lake Geneva; great views over the lake and to the Alps. Short walk to the lakefront, the port (for a boat trip to Evian or elsewhere on the lake), and adjacent to the Olympic museum and a metro stop. All the staff are very open and helpful. The breakfast on the terrace is very nice, and the other restaurants are excellent. The indoor and outdoor pools are large, heated and very pleasant. Not inexpensive by any means, but worth the price.",
Truly beautiful hotel,"Beau-Rivage is a truly beautiful hotel. The room is elegant but not in a dusty-curtains kind of way. Lots of closet space, good size bathroom. Room service was impeccable (sometimes hotels just give you a watered down version of the restaurant). The grounds were also gorgeous with a lovely view of the lake. Felt private and safe. Service also fabulous, from the front desk to concierge to door men. Exactly what is needed during a hectic business trip! Will definitely return when back in Lausanne. ",
What a 5-star experience should be,"Spent here a couple of night while on a business trip and I can honestly said that I had the 5-star experience in every aspect. From excellent, classic-style rooms, to an amazing cafe-restaurant, exquisite enjoying of wine in the evening while overlooking the garden and proper, attentive service. Beau-Rivage Palace certainly is worth the money spent on it, but also make sure that you’ve got a big room (some rooms are pretty small ones). I completely enjoyed the marvellous breakfast with a stunning view under the sunshine and the nicely prepared rooms. In terms of meeting/conference facilities, the hotel also delivers and I really can’t think of a better place to stay in Lausanne! A class! ",
Wonderful Stay,The hotel has great staff and service. Lovely and charming bedroom overlooking the lake with breathtaking views! I really enjoyed my stay and wish I could stay longer. Great location in front of the lake.,
Expensive but stunning!,"Enjoyed 3 days at this beautiful hotel. Fabulous room, outstanding service and gorgeous outdoor pool overlooking lake Geneva. The breakfast was truly gorgeous and set in the most beautiful glass building with stunning views. Absolutely luxurious although much more expensive than a similar hotel in the Uk. The best part of £23 for a gin and tonic! Think of a price and double it but for a special weekend away and for some serious top level facilities and service this is the place to go. Easy to reach by train and good location for visiting other Swiss towns. Despite the cost, will return. This hotel is very special. ",
Not as good as in the past,"I went in this hotel a few years ago and I was really impressed by the service, the nice amenities in room, everything was perfect. I decided to stop there with the family. It was still good but not as much as before. The children were welcomed with balloons and a cookie, but nothing for us adults. Not even a few fruits. Nothing at night neither ... I was a bit disappointed as last time it was so perfect. I try to explain it to the front desk but it was very clear that I was considered as just another annoying client... so I left a bit sad with the impression that time have changed",
Relaxing!,We had an excellent afternoon tea. Very relaxing. The service was perfect. The scones could be slightly more flavoury thow and the door giving on terrace should stay closed in winter. A large choice of nice pastries. ,
Top class hotel,Already upon entering it becomes very clear that this is one of the best hotels in the world. The halls are spacious and decorated very stylish and luxorious. The food and service of the restaurant from Anne-Sophie Pic is just from another world. In my entire life I have never tasted anything that rich and complex. The junior suite was unbelieveable! Thank you so much!,
Quite average,"As person who's been to a fair bit of 5 star Swiss hotels I have to say that Beau Rivage is laying on old fame. The room was beautiful but avarage and it was quite surprising that there were no amenities of any kind - no plate of sweets or even a few pieces of fruit, which is very uncommon for a luxury hotel. ",
Excellent Service,"Stayed for a night recently. The Beau Rivage is a huge palatial hotel. Easy to get lost in. Its not easy to review a place in one night, however the service was friendly and efficient. The suite was elegant with an amazingly comfortable bed. Forgot to ask where they source their mattresses. Quick visit but would come back",
Great historical hotel,"The hotel is a fantastic place to stay while in Switzerland. The rooms are great size, in very good condition, and has everything you would want whether on business or pleasure nothing is overlooked at this wonderful Hotel. Very close to shopping, museums, and the panoramic views of the lake are amazing. You could take the ferry across to France, but remember to bring your passport. The food in the hotel is very good, and the breakfast buffet has everything you would want. The staff goes Far and Beyond one would expect. The gardens are beautiful, and I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. I would certainly recommend this hotel, and make sure you have time to spend in the spa as it is one of the best in the country. The historic charm of the hotel with the modern",
Could not be more impressed!,"Stayed 2 separate weekends in January 2019 in Junior suite with lovely view of the lake and beyond. Would highly recommend corner suite 560 which is magnificent. Rooms are very spacious and bright and in delicate colours, comfortable beds. Ample closet space. Generous bathrooms with white(!) towels. The concierge team (particularly Allen) work wonders - they even managed to find a table for us at a Michelin 3* restaurant (a miracle) at short notice! Transfers were without a hitch. Basically the staff will know who you are and make you feel welcome. We are trying to think of a reason to return soon!",
Miss LC,"I ate at the brasserie around Christmas time for a special occasion and it was fantastic service, great food and all what I had hoped for. I decided to share this wonderful experience with four members of my family for my birthday. I had been told when booking, that the restaurant was being renovated and that we would be seated in the bar area. This was not a problem at all. Unfortunately, the experience did not live up to my family and I’s expectations. The staff were forgetful and we felt rushed. Only two of us were asked what we would like to order for food...so we had to call back the waitress to finish our order. An entrée was taken away by the waiter when my mother hadn’t finished. We stood waiting for our coats for 15mins before we were asked what we could be helped",
Great hotel and awesome location,"Very close to the train station! You can get off the train and ride the metro to a short walk to your 5 star hotel. We were very pleased with the location! The staff is wonderful, friendly, and helpful! Everyone smiles! It was decorated for Christmas and wow! Historic look and feel with amazing woodwork in the hotel. Just beautiful! The breakfast was delicious and a great start to the day! The bathroom was spacious and blissful with the warming towel rack. Amazing start to our visit!",
Bar à Bulles - Worst service ever but lovely setting,"I made a reservation by phone in your „Bar à bulles“ for 8 people for December 22nd. When we arrived, I got told the reservation was for 6 people and it’s gonna be a problem as you were fully booked. The Hostess did not want to give us two additional chairs, even tough the bar was completly empty when we arrived. The waiter came in, ignored us and started to clean the tables around us. I called him, asked if we could order and he said he tought we might want to wait until everybody arrived, we were 5 at the beginning, instead of just asking us. When the other people arrived, one of them asked for a glass of white wine. The waiters answer was first no. Then we had to explain that she does not like champagne and he said he could do an exception as we already ordered a Magnum of",
Amazing as always,"I love everything about this hotel. From the location right in front of the lake, friendly staff, lovely and clean rooms. Amazing breakfast. Smooth check in and check out, I was even given my room by noon, even though check in time is 3 PM. Try to get a room with a view on the lake, such a breathtaking view. Won’t be my last time.",
What a wonderful place!,"We had a faultless stay at the beau rivage, a real pleasure from start to finish! We left feeling very relaxed and of course full from a wonderful breakfast! They do everything they can to be as helpful and friendly as possible :)",
Best choice in Lausanne!,"The hotel is a gorgeous palace, perfectly located by the lake. Town is easily accessible by taxi and given that public transport is included in the city tax and metro & bus not even 5-minutes walking distance, the location is ideal for leisure and business. The beautifully designed room with a balcony and a stunning view of the lake includes a well sized desk also with a view of the lake (little bonus for working). The staff is helpful, always with a smile on their face. BEST: the bed and the view",
Beautiful hotel,This is a beautiful place. The staff has been amazing. The room was nice but a little small. The entrance and grounds were amazing. When we are back in Switzerland we will definitely stay here again. Just be warned it is expensive the food is as well. But it is beautiful.,
Winter or Summer..always a pleasure!,"Our first stay was during a long summer weekend whereas the second one was a short winter stay and on both occasions we were very happy with the way this grand hotel is run. It is very grand it terms of appearance and of course history but it gives the impression of a family run hotel, where everyone is concerned to make your stay as comfortable as possible. What was very sweet was the winter garden with a merry go round for kids! We could not fault the hotel in any way!",
Christmas weekend away,"Arrived at the Beau Rivage Palace and was blown away by the sheer elegance and beauty of the place. Beautifully decorated for Christmas and the Interior was something else. We sat in the garden surrounded by twinkly lights and warm blankets. There was a carousel for the kids in the garden which was beautifully decorated. You should really take the time to explore The interior of the hotel, it is incredible. Everything was immaculate, staff were as you would expect, courteous and attentive. Drinks are expensive as you would expect, great wines and food. Can’t wait to go again at the same time again next year, just magical.",
Very Nice Hotel by Lake Geneva,"Beautiful, large luxury rooms, some with a lake view. From the others you will be in the woods. The staff is very helpful. There are a couple of nice restaurants, of different styles. They are ok, not outstanding. Breakfast is good and the view from the breakfast room is superb! The impression I got was the hotel was built in stages, so you will feel to be in a maze when you walk around. But you will get over it.",
Couples escapade,"We spent a truly wonderful 1 night stay in this magnificent hotel where the staff were helpful, professional & discreet. I would highly recommend it. The spa was lovely, the room quaint with a lovely view of the fog covered lake. Thanks everyone...... 🙂",
Brilliant stay @ BRP,"Although it started pretty rough with our luggage being lost by KLM in Amsterdam we were met @ BRP with tremendous swiss hospitality and most helpful staff. The senior concierge was most helpful. Our first room needed heavy TLC and was granny style, but this was no issue at all, at was promtly changed at no extra cost to a more contemporary room, appropriate for this hotel category. Degustibus non disputandum! The spa and therapists were outstanding. We enjoyed a few excellent massages. Miyako, their japanese tepanyaki restaurant offered good sushi and solid tepan dishes. Arrigato gozaimasu! The bar is standard, the drinks were unfortunately on the watery side- I cannot really recommend the bar, service sluggish. Their breakfast buffet was average for a hotel of this category,",
Nice not great,"My partner her daughter and myself stayed here, to be honest the swimming pools weren’t very warm. The room was nice but I thought not five star no more than four star I would return if everything else in the area was full ",
Le très beau rivage... amazing place,"I have the chance to go to the Beau-Rivage few times a year in a business context. But I had so far not taken the time to write a review. Last stay was so amazing that I decided it was definitely time to write something nice :) This is a very unique place as the view from the rooms, recently renovated is amazing. The calm of the lake and the inspiration of the mountains... Service is absolutely perfect - the best I have experienced so far in Europe. And food and drinks experiences are also excellent. If you have the chance to pass by with family or for business, this is the price of a palace but you get a real palace :) and if you don’t have this chance, don’t hesitate to provoke it...",
Best hotel I’ve ever stayed,"It’s almost an understatement to call this a palace. From the very comfortable bed to the automatic built in bidet in the toilet to the television inside the mirror in the bathroom, no luxury is spared. All lighting and shade control is centrally controlled which takes a little getting used to. The location is ideal, right on the lake. The staff is amazing. The fitness center and spa is immaculate with indoor and outdoor swimming options. The food at all events was exquisite. ",
Above all expectations,We just came back from a 2 day friends and family trip to this hotel. We were 9 adults and 5 kids. We had an amaizing time. The place is beautiful and the staff is truly amazing. We will definitely come back and we would recommend the hotel to anyone that goes to Lausanne (even if you have kids).,
I finally had a balcony,"What an amazing hotel. It's at least on the same level with places such as Suvretta House or the Dolder. In fact, it's ahead of them as comes without the ""stiffness"" (for the lack of a better word). It's utterly friendly and charming. We had a fantastic suite and from the balcony I could overlook Lac Leman, enjoy the view on the French Alps and speak to the peasants (non there unfortunately)...",
Beautiful hotel in a beautiful town,"Put this hotel on your bucket list. Sited right on Lake Geneva, spectacular views from most rooms of France across the lake. Elegant and impressive. A wonderful experience. Great staff. You can walk straight from the hotel to the lake shore. Excellent spa. Fantastic, memorable experience.",
"Amazing service, old rooms, charm of tradition","amazing legendary building, fully refurbished inside and modern in an old building. great service, best in class. try a view on the lake. silent rooms, great food, ample parking space. gym is small. highly recommended.",
One of the best hotels in the world,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and I love it! The staaf is very, very friendly and you are extremely well taken care of. The rooms are very beautifully decorated and very well cleaned. The breakfast is very good and the bar is also very nice! I will surely come back!",
The Place to be in Lausanne,"Excellent 5 star hotel for a townlike Lausanne beeing not new york or Paris... the hotel is situated right in front of the Lake of Geneva, with a great garden and indorr and outdoor swimming pool, the hotel has all the facilities of an internation 5 stars hotel",
Forty-Eight Hour Luxury,"My wife and I spent two days in the lap of luxury at the Beau-Rivage Palace. The staff, from the valet, front desk, housekeeping, spa, food and beverage staff did their absolute best to assure us a wonderful, relaxing stay. Our junior suite offered us an unparalleled view of the lake. My wife returned from her spa treatment as relaxed as I've ever seen her.I would recommend the Beau-Rivage Palace to anyone in need of a restorative stay.",
Classic luxury - best choice in Lausanne,"We stayed in Aug 2018 only for 1 night as part of our short trip to Lake Geneva area. To make long story short - hotel is indeed deserves its 5 starts all the way. It starts from the arrival experience when your name is passed from doormen to reception so that when you arrive to reception you are already greeted by name, it continues with excellent service in all areas, with immaculately clean rooms and public spaces, with beautiful territory and excellent food - so no wonders why this hotel is currently ranked #1 in Lausanne and among Top 25 in Switzerland on TripAdvisor site. Despite hotel was fully booked as Leaders Club members we were still upgraded to partial Lake view room. It was room in newer building (hotel consists of 2 buildings - older one where the main reception",
Excellence in all respects,"This is truly a five star hotel. The service is incredible, the property is impeccable. We had a fantastic view of Lac Leman and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel grounds and surrounding area. I would highly recommend a pleasant stay at this property. ",
The Very Best,"We were not originally booked into this hotel, but were lucky enough to get an upgrade to the Beau Rivage Palace, we considered ourselves very lucky! Check in was conducted very professionally, the same person who checked us in gave us a brief tour of the ground floor area and then escorted us to our room and explained how everything worked. The room was extremely spacious, well set out, well furnished and very clean. We had breakfast at the hotel and the standard and variety of food presented was excellent. Service was efficient, but unobtrusive. On a personal note - it was my husband's birthday and he received a lovely box of chocolates from the hotel!",
Epitome of Swiss Hospitality,"I can't speak highly enough of the Beau-Rivage Palace. My daughter and I stayed for a week in a room with lake and mountain views. Every time we opened the curtains, we were astounded by the vista. And what a pleasant surprise to find a welcome gift of local wine, fruit and crackers - such an elegant touch. The hotel and grounds are absolutely gorgeous and pristine - from the amazing flower arrangements to the relaxing terraces and common areas. But the real reason to stay at the Beau-Rivage is its staff: every single person we dealt with during our stay could not have been more helpful, welcoming and friendly. Whether it was taking care of a package I needed to mail to London, or giving us advice on where to pick up basics like clothes hangers for my daughter's dorm",
Beau-Rivage Palace = Excellence in every respect,"Words cannot really tell how the hotel exceeds customers' expectations! We stayed in a room facing the lake and the Alps: stunning view. The room was perfect, breakfast was superb, facilities are impressive (spa, pools, garden). Dined at Café Beau Rivage: lovely place and amazing food. Enjoyed lake view at night from our room's balcony. Staff is first-class, professional, welcoming and attentive to every detail. You can see that customer satisfaction is the hotel's main focus.",
Meets every expectation,"Once in a while a hotel stay lives up to every expectation, even when those expectations were already high. But so our visit to the Beau-Rivage Palace proved. Yes, the room was exceptionally well appointed, yes the outlook over the lake was a delight, and yes, the breakfast on the terrace was sumptuous. But it was more than that. The staff genuinely seemed to care about every aspect of making their guests welcome. Should our travels return us to Lausanne, so too would we wish to return to the Beau-Rivage.",
They really take trouble,"As ever, we were extremely impressed by the Beau Rivage. The attention to detail is so impressive and makes it so easy to relax: for instance they had set up a lovely bed for our child (complete with helium balloon tied to it) and supplied a bathrobe for his use. As always the quality of the room itself was first class. We will certainly return!",
GREAT LOCATION !,"Loved our stay here! Large hotel with a sort of boutique hotel feel.... Views from some rooms are outstanding. We happened to arrive early and in an effort to accomodate us, got a room with a lesser view, but still lovely.....",
"Beautiful hotel, but bathroom configuration is not designed for efficiency","This is an absolutely beautiful old hotel with a breathtaking view of Lac Léman. The baroque decor of the rooms is straight out of the mid-19th century. You could spend a day just looking at the decor and the artwork in the hotel. Service is also impressive with the staff obviously well trained in getting the job done with a minimal amount of guest interaction. My only objection is a personal one. As I was traveling on business, I found the bathroom layout to be less useful than I would prefer. Ironically, this was due to the large size of the bathroom. Moving between the shower, towel rack, and sink took surprisingly more effort than I am used to in typical hotel rooms intended for business travelers. In Lausanne, I typically stay at the Movenpick Hotel which has much less",
Great location and wonderful stay,"We stayed at the Beau-Rivage Palace my wife and I for 3 nights as part of a trip to Switzerland.. The hotel is in front of Lake Geneva on the riviera. Our room was facing the lake. Our room was nice and quiet and had a wonderful view. The staff is helpful and the hotel is located in a very nice neighborhood. There are a lot of cafe and restaurant around. The riviera is very lively at this time of the year, so we did really enjoy our stay. We would definitely return. Good price for the value.",
4 lovely days,"This hotel has all the amenities we required. The better bedrooms have a lovely view of lake Geneva and with small balcony worth paying for. The weather was great which helped. 2 great swimming pools, one outdoors, which I preferred this time. The one indoors is equally as good. Service at the poolside was fine. Breakfast was good, but did not have evening meals there, except for one meal at Sofia Pique, which was very nice but no WOW. Rather expensive for what was on offer. The only down comment, and why I did not give it 5 stars, was service on the terrace, which was rather slow, and the staff, although very friendly, seemed to be rather overcome by it all, and not quite knowing what was going on. All together a very nice resting a city with a lot of attractions. In good",
Special experience - all around satisfied,"We took advantage of the popup hotel offer and did some ""Glamping"" (glamour camping) in the gardens of the Beau-Rivage Palace. Since we were there for the national holiday we also booked their exclusive Aug 1 buffet. All around an excellent decision - we had a terrific stay! Highly recommended :)",
What a treat!,"Once you move in and unpack your bags, take a stroll outside along the lake! Take a breath and you will understand why Coco Chanel and so many more famous people of the world love this hotel! Rich art Nuevo designs of each ball room, wall papers from the gilded era, fruits and deserts to your pleasure. Staff that here and not in your face, multiple bars and restaurants to make you comfortable,beatiful breakfast terrace and room balconies. Everything will please you through all your 5 senses.",
Exquisite Luxury Spa,"Perfect location on the shores of Lake Geneva. Beautiful facility decorated and maintained with attention to even the smallest of details. Beautiful fresh flowers throughout the buildings to include a live orchid in the room. If you are not swept off your feet by the beauty you will be by the polite, profession and very attentive staff. If you stay book at least one spa treatment...you will feel completely spoiled by the wonderful staff in the spa. ",
This was the Best,"This year everything was perfect and the hospitality faultless. We have spent annual holidays at the Hotel since 2010 and the hotel has lost none of its charm and magnetic pull to return. Dining at Sophie Pic's was an unforgettable highlight, the breakfasts unbeatable and the poolside lunchtime dinning of a unbelievable high quality and a daily pleasure. The grounds are a joy where with a leisurely walk you can enjoy the magnificent views in peace. This year everyone's enthusiastic welcome gave us a perfect holiday. Last year we didn't book our holiday directly with the hotel and encountered difficulties in securing the facilities we requested. After this problem we have resolved always to book our hotel reservations directly as was our normal practice. Time is too short to",
Incredible luxury!,"I highly recommend the Beau-Rivage Palace. The location is as good as it gets and the service is perfection. The staff is attentive and the amenities are exceptional. My only regret is that we did not have the change to stay longer. My travel agent told me this hotel was a must, and she was absolutely right.",
Old World Elegance with first class service,"From the moment we walked into this stunning hotel we felt welcomed and were treated like valued guests! The property is absolutely beautiful and is situated with a stunning view of Lake Geneva. The guest rooms are beautiful, spacious, comfortable and clean and have all the modern amenities, including air conditioning. Every person from the front desk clerk to the bellman to the concierge, wait staff and housekeeping staff were all very polite and anxious to please. There is no need to look for other dining options; the hotel provides first class dining in service, quality and variety of food selections in beautiful settings. We also had room service for a late night snack and wine and it arrived promptly and was beautifully set up by the gentleman who delivered it to us. The",
A Grand Hotel with a beating heart.,"Choosing a well appointed large scale hotel in Europe in the summer has its subtleties. It needs to be capable of embracing large scale events without being overwhelmed by them and ensuring a solo guest like myself is unaffected. I have stayed at this property on five occasions and I have always felt specially attended to no matter what else is ""going down"" in the property. I was met by Sophie at the beginning of my stay and she set the benchmark for providing what I love about this part of the world Swiss efficiency and shy charm blended with French flare. It continued onwards through the Beau Rivage Cafe, Room Service Supper and the extra ordinary culinary experience which is ASP at the BRP. The food offerings delivered in spades but whether its the house keeping ( a gentle",
Mixed Feelings,"The property has a nice appearance from the outside, however, the public areas and especially the room that we were allocated were underwhelming given the price we paid. The room, although having a splendid view of the lake, looked more befitting a 3 or 4 star hotel, not a luxury resort. Although it was clean, it was not like a room which is shown in the pictures on the hotel's website. Perhaps, they will do a refurbishment soon. The breakfast, however, was outstanding in both offerings and location/ambience. Dinner at the Italian Restaurant L'Accademia was very disappointing. The food quality was very poor and the bread they served appeared to be hard/stale. We had an issue at the bar where we used a voucher that we received upon check-in which stated ",
A summer down? Inconsistent service - lack of personnel?,"Being a regular guest in this beautiful top class hotel and having had an absolutely perfect experience in spring, I was even more disappointed on this stay. Being member of the LHW club we didn’t received the usual benefits: no room upgrade and no early check-in (subject to availability, I conceive), no personalized welcome, just one welcome gift for the 4 of us. We also didn’t got this wonderful feeling of being „welcomed back“ as regular guest. Maybe related to an important renewal of the staff? The service around the pool was not up to standard and clearly lacking personnel. We hardly never saw somebody we could have asked for a beachchair towel and the pool bar/restaurant was closed on a beautiful, sunny saturday afternoon. Many guest were surprised or complained but this",
Perfection,"I had the chance to spend one of the amazing experiences I ever had in this hotel. Every moment has been enjoyment, location is unique close to lake with a beautiful garden where you can relax and have breakfast, hotel is beautifully decorated with magnificent flowers everywhere. Personnel is friendly and extremely professional. Of course all this comes with a price but definitely a Place to try if your budget allows it.",
Resort-style venue for events, hotel is secondary to management,"We spent a week at Beau-Rivage Palace, and it was very nice, but too loud because of several large events that dominated the atmosphere. I will first list my compliments, and later in the review are my disappointments. There are two buildings, and the building with the lobby feels old and tired. Thankfully, our room was in the other building which was recently renovated. The room was tasteful, elegant, comfortable, and boasted a balcony with stunning view over the lake and mountains. The ballroom and event spaces are below, and they can get very loud. Additionally, the process of setting-up and taking-down all the equipment for the events adds to the noise and busy atmosphere of the resort. The food is absolutely excellent, and the staff are professional. Some staff,"
"Excellent location, view and hospitality",The hotel is excellent .. rooms are perfect the location is amazing .. the service was great . We really loved the location and the hotel and ill absoloutely come to visit it again. No other comments thank you for the hospitality,
"Outstanding service, tired rooms","The hotel sits on a very scenic part of Lake Geneva and the service is 5 star however, we were very disappointed with our room. We stayed for 5 nights, paying 780 CHF per night and were given a tired room, above the bar, where cigar smoke/cigarette smoke poured into the room all day and into the late evening. The bathroom is just hazardous and there is no separate shower. The step in and out of the bath is an accident waiting to happen. The furniture was unattractive and the bed not particularly comfortable. We are world travelers and stay in 5 star accommodation. Sadly, for rooms (and jet lag recovery) we would put this at the bottom of our list. For service we would put this at the top of the list. ",
Deservedly - One of the Greatest Hotels in the World,"What is there not to say about this hotel - breathtaking reviews, old style luxury, great gardens, top quality restaurants and understated classy service. A true legend. And continually being refurbished to provide the very latest ameneties",
Fabulous stay,"We stayed at the Beau Rivage Palace for one night and from the beginning to the end it was fabulous! The staff was very friendly and helpful! We felt welcomed the second we stepped into the hotel! We had a very nice room with a beautiful view over the lake! Exceptional! The breakfast was huge and there were so many choices!

Great Expectations,"Having Stayed at Royal Hotel Evian a few times past we could see the town of Lausanne opposite across Lake Geneva and wanted to try it as we enjoyed the lake vistas. Beau Rivage looked a good fit as is 5 stars a leading Hotel of the World and also Lakeside ,separated by a fairly busy road but the noise is not obtrusive . During the week before arrival we received an email offering a reduced upgrade to our pre booked room which surprised us a bit as being LHW members if a upgrades are available we often get gratuitous ones . A 3 hour delay from London to Geneva caused by French traffic control did not improve the mood especially as it was raining getting off the plane but Sophie on reception at Beau Rivage was all smiles ,subtleness and efficiency as she dealt with my enquiry",
Great facility but service needs serious improvement,"We stayed at Beau Rivage from 29 June until 1st July. We booked a suite 552. The hotel itself is breathtaking. The view from the room is out of this world. So for seekers of romance and the wow effect, it is the place to be. The downsides are: 1- concierge desk has one attendant. Although the desk staff are well informed and very helpful, it took sometime to get to speak to them. On 2 occasions I had to wait for few minutes to get what I want sorted so I truly did not mind. 2- the area that truly upset me is the staff at the breakfast area and the club lounge. They lack basic training and sometimes curtesy. First day, we had to wait for few minutes at the breakfast area without an attendant at the desk. They were all inside and could see us without any of them taking any",
Swiss Perfection!,"The Beau-Rivage Palace truly is a five star experience from check-in to departure. The staff across the board are friendly and yet extremely capable and professional. My room overlooked the gardens with wonderful views of Lac Leman. Spacious and very comfortable. The hotel is ideally located just up from the lake and a short walk to the Olympic Museum. The restaurants offer a wide range of options, and each meal was perfection. Truly a wonderful experience and I look forward to returning.",
Where dreams are made,"Such a beautiful hotel. It really feels like a palace. The staff and service are first rate. A perfect spot for a very special vacation. Overlooking the Alps, the views are breathtaking. The staff make one feel as if one really matters.",
Great Old Hotel (though you do pay for it),"Stayed for one night. As I was arriving from a red-eye flight I thought I spend the extra and get to hang out by the pool for the afternoon. And nice pool it is. While the service is very good you have to adjust for the Swiss peculiarities. I received a pre-arrival email querying my arrival time. I was expecting to arrive at 2pm. I received a prompt response the arrival time was noted, but official check in time is at 3pm. Sure, I get this, but if you reword the message saying we'll do our utmost to have your room ready at the noted time, but it is always not possible etc etc the perception is very different. The pool side service was not comparable what you would expect elsewhere at a 5 star hotel. Towels were there, but I had to set up the lounger myself. An elderly gentleman",
Beautiful and Scenic Hotel,"My first trip to Lausanne, a scenic town not too far from Geneva and I decided on the Beau-Rivage Palace hotel. This historic hotel has more than a 100 years history, dating back to 1861. It’s also the site of several important historic events, the most famous being the treaty of Lausanne in 1923. Arrival I arrived by taxi from Lausanne train station. The Beau-Rivage impresses even upon the entrance. On arrival, my bags were unloaded and I was escorted for check-in. The hotel sits at the edge of Lake Lemar and the views of the lake were throughout the hotel. I was escorted to my room by the friendly staff. The Room I booked an entry level superior room with lake view and the room comes with a balcony, and is located at the top floor. It’s nicely decorated, although much",
Absolutely perfect.,"Everything about this hotel is great. The rooms are spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. The hotel is exceptional, the gardens beautifully tended to. The best part about the hotel though is the staff. Everyone was so proactive in making sure that we enjoyed our time there and went above and beyond to ensure it. ",
Wonderful hotel and location,"My husband and I spent three nights here this past week. We arrived mid morning and were promptly welcomed at the registration desk. We were given a room upgrade (due to our United status and and reserving through the Luxury Hotel Collection. Our room was not ready but we were told it would just be a few minutes - well worth the wait. The young lady at the desk gave us a quick tour of the lobby area and took us to our room directly. It was a junior suite with a wonderful view over Lake Geneva with a small balcony, lovely living room area and the grandest bathroom - two separate sink areas and a jacuzzi tub for two. We were thrilled with the accommodations, the service and all of the staff. We had breakfast included and the staff in the dining room room were helpful,",
Outstanding,In every dimension! A friend said: “It comes close to my idea of paradise.” I can’t find a better way to describe the performance of the Beau Rivage. We are looking forward to come back as soon as possible! ,
Superb!,"We recently spent a weekend at The Beau Rivage. Suffice it to say that this is amongst the very best hotels in Switzerland (and for that matter Europe and the world!) The lovingly maintained grand building, the grounds, restaurants and bar are splendid. Rooms are spacious, quiet with a comfortable bed and have an amazing shower. What really makes the hotel is the staff. Everyone is polite, smiling, helpful and professional. We ate at Anne Sophie-Pic. Well worth eating there but make sure to book in advance. It was our second visit and we shall be back for many more.",
Amazing Hotel,Brilliant! Our stay was fantastic.surpassed our expectations. The staff were amazing and the facilities and food were delicious. The views of the lake were beautiful. Our son also really enjoyed our stay. ,
Excellent Location & Amazing Staff,"Its one of the finest places to stay in Switzerland; the view of the lake, the rooms in the new wing are simply amazing. Breakfast layout, bar, service of the staff is spectacular. The bar is also great.",
Stunning Hotel,Wow! This is some hotel! Only had one night here and would loved to have stayed longer. It is very very expensive but you pay for the stunning views on Lake Geneva and the rooms and bathrooms are to die for. Just be aware that when sitting outside there are many sparrows around. Lovely as they are they do peck away at the nibbles and nuts on the tables which may explain why I had an upset stomach the next day!! But definitely the place to stay if you go to Lausanne. ,
Perfectly maintained historic settings with wonderful service... Probably the best hotel in Lausanne..!,"I had stayed at this wonderful lakeside hotel in Lausanne for just one day some 12 years ago but as it had made a lasting impression on me, I chose it again for our 25th wedding anniversary getaway with my wife. The hotel itself was in an even better shape with recent and continuous renovations and updates and the service was still one of the best that I have ever experienced as a very frequent traveller. A very clean, classy and elegant hotel, Beau-Rivage Palace Lausanne has all, a majestic history, beautiful location right by one of Europe's most picturesque lakes surrounded by high mountains, as well as right in the centre of Lausanne with many attractions within walking distance, wonderful hotel grounds with pool and sunbathing as well as various leisure time possibilities.",
perfect location in Lausanne,"This is definitely my pick for hotels while in Lausanne. The location is absolutely perfect, right next to The Ouchey Castle and port. Within a few minute walk you can grab a boat for a lake excursion or grab the metro. This hotel is definitely one of the finest in Europe and their staff is completely amazing! I was upgraded to a Jr Suite on the 5th floor in the palace wing and I swear that I was given the finest room in the entire hotel! Request one of the corner Jr suites with views of the castle, Lake Geneva and the Savoy Alps if possible, but anything facing the lake would offer a spectacular view.",
The best hotel in Lausanne,"I had a very big room (more like an apartment) with a very nice view on the lake. The bathroom was beautiful, there’s even a tv in the mirror! The staff was charming, the hotel was perfectly located and has lots of good restaurants. ",
Very expensive lunch for the quality,We called in here for lunch and were very disappointed. We both had the ‘fish and chips’ and as one reviewer recently wrote ‘$50 for a hamburger is outrageous’ I tend to agree paying $68 ea for fish and chips is also outrageous! It was nothing special and the pomme frites were just regular pomme frites! The service was just ok...waiters seemed bored and not very friendly. I am glad we didn’t book this hotel to stay at!,
Timeless elegance and the finest of service,"I used to live in Switzerland, in Montreux, and since I return regularly, I always want my experience to feel as though I am home again. I have stayed at all of the luxury hotels in the canton and all the way to Geneva and The Beau Rivage Palace meets and exceeds them all in every way. The views are dreamy and the shores of Lac Laman are a very short walk (just across the street). The lovely walk to the shopping area with the department store Bon Genie and the many beautiful shops are walkable and the vineyards and Lutry are very close as well. Swiss wineries and the wines are a well kept sectret and all the small villages that line the Swiss riviera are so charming and breathtakingly beautiful and not far from the hotel. The rooms are spacious and tastefully and recently",
excellent hotel,"Beautiful location at lakeside with view onto well-tailored garden, lake and mountains; hotel style majestic and beautifully renovated. Outstanding breakfast buffet. One of my favorite hotels in light of its high quality and style.",
Luxury experience!,"I really liked this place. All was perfect: the food, the service , the excelent view of the lake, the parking. The classic decoration of the diferent spacious and the beautiful gardens. That night we had a delicious dinner .",
No distinction of kids vs no kids areas... catastrophic for relaxation,"The hotel is fine but there is a major issue with regards to how kids are managed... We tried to go down to the spa and were basically in a kids kindergarden - you try to sit in the jacuzzi and you get jumped in by 5 3-4 year olds with floaters around their arms, screams non-stop, parents who think it’s totally normal and worse staff that lets it all go by while several couples were trying to relax and ended up leaving the premises one after the other... The day after you go to breakfast and there too, you sit at your table hoping to enjoy your morning and you get 3 tables of small kids beside you with more screams. Maybe the hotel should seriously think of restraining access to some areas of the ‘relaxing spa’ to under 14 ages kids and reserve areas within the breakfast areas",
Old world elegance,"One of the truly grand hotels of Europe, old world elegance with all the modern conveniences and impeccable service. Had a renovated room overlooking the lake with views of Evian in the distance. Only think lacking was a coffee maker in the room.",
Excellent location and beautiful views.,"This was our second visit to this beautiful and classic hotel. We had a room with a view of the lake. The room was spacious with a very large bathroom. I loved the spa facilities here from the gym, sauna, steam room, pool and hot tub-I used these facilities daily. The staff and concierge here helped us arrange to send our very heavy suitcase via Swiss rail to our next location . There are many restaurants in the hotel and steps away from other restaurants. It is a short walk to the Olympic museum and steps away from strolling down the lake promenade. There is an outdoor terrace with excellent service and views of the beautiful lawn.",
Fantastic hotel,"This is a true 5star hotel, certainly one of the best in Switzerland and in Europe. It has tremendous history, great views (make sure you pay up for lakeside rooms), immaculate rooms and first-rate service. We were very impressed with this hotel. It’s certainly expensive but given the overall quality it’s actually good value for money. We also loved the afternoon tea. Highly recommended hotel if you want to splash out for a memorable experience. ",
"Great hotel, attentive service","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Beau-Rivage. The room was large, clean, and quiet with modern amenities (nespresso machine). Located on the lake, it is just a short bus ride to the city center. The staff (reception, concierge, bar, spa, and dining room) were all attentive and friendly.",
Best hotel in the world!,Another fabulous stay in what I feel is the best hotel I’ve ever been to. After my 4-star review in 2016 (change of management?) I had the chance to come back several times and observe with delight the hotels way back to highest levels. And once more: more than it’s luxurious beauty it’s clearly the staff which brings this gem to top level. Every single person you meet is perfectly trained and makes you feel at home. And a huge pleasure: as a regular guest you feel treated like a king. Thank you so much to the entire BRP team for another unforgettable stay!,
A must,"Amazing hotel. Outstanding attentive service. Great location and breathtaking views over lake Geneva (for lake facing rooms). The rooms are beautiful and functional. The bars, lounges and restaurants, including iconic Anne-Sophie Pic, are all top notch. The spa and 2 pools are luxurious and open year-round. I just spent an unforgettable weekend at Beau Rivage Palace and recommend it for a true 5-star experience. This remains one of the very top hotels in the world. I will go back and highly recommend it!",
A big rip off- such a shame,"This hotel is a great historic hotel with a beautiful setting and beautiful common rooms. It sits on Lake Geneva and one would expect to love the place. i could not wait to leave! I travel around the world and stay at great hotels on a very frequent basis. I accept that these places are rather pricey. But Beau rivage Palace takes the cake. For instance, I asked for a simple hamburger without looking at the menu. what a mistake. When i got the bill the hamburger costs over $50. Come on! the lauder service pricing was completely insane. for a few undergarments and a few t shirts, the cost was over $150. i went down the street and had a excellent job for $15. Also, the rooms are really old fashion and desperately in need of update. they have that old synthetic material for the",
Visited for a day,"We didn’t stay here but spend the day and had lunch, did a little shopping and then had tea & snacks at the piano bar. It’s an must go to palace. I must admit I was disappointed in the service just a little. We had an arrogant waiter for lunch but other than that everything was lovely and the history and ballrooms are outstanding. I will be sure to book a trip to come and enjoy during the spring. ",
"Terrible stay, would not recommend","Stayed for 2 nights. Was allocated a room overlooking the car park. Room was sweltering hot and had a very uncomfortable stay. Slept very poorly. Food in restaurant in the evening was delayed in arriving, despite set menu. Hotel appeared tired. Was very disappointed and would not recommend.",
An experience worth your while,"We have been in a lot of hotels of all levels around the world but the Beau Rivage stands in a league of its own. Both the ladies the gentlemen at the front desk are very welcoming and professional. The attention to detail is excellent. Breakfast again, was excellent. It is also worth your while to have closer look at all the different features of the building itself, beginning in your own bedroom. This building oozes history, both past and recent. The Beau Rivage is more than a hotel… It’s an experience.",
EXCELLENCE IN EVERY RESPECT!,"What can we possibly say about the Beau-Rivage Palace that isn't already abundantly obvious to everyone who has read anything about this magnificent establishment? It is the place where on 24 July 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed. The International Olympic movement's headquarters are literally next door. Sitting in a glorious Belle Epoque building fronting the shores of Lake Geneva, the Beau-Rivage Palace is one of the most luxurious hotels a jet setter could ever stay at. Magnificent lobby, unbelievable hallways that take the breath away. Amazing function rooms with ornate ceilings, and guest rooms that are top end luxury. Our room featured a television embedded into the bathroom mirror! The staff are wonderful, and courteous, none more so than Beat Ganz who loves every",
Biloxi Fun,"The Beau-Rivage is one of the most beautiful Hotel/Casino/Shopping and Restaurant complex we have visited on the Gulf Coast. Southern hospitality at its finest! Great food, awesome casino selections to choose for your enjoyment. A Must come to place for all to enjoy!",
Superb,A true icon in the Swiss hospitality industry. Nathalie Seiler and her team ensure that it stays that way. Great rooms with great restaurant and spa/gym facilities. Not to miss is their Japanese restaurant which is always busy. Also the outside terrace in summer is so truly wonderful and probably the best place to enjoy the lakeside of Ouchy. The Beau Rivage really sets the example of a Swiss hotel which is well maintained and exceeds guests expectations. I can't wait to return!,
Fantastic setting on lake Geneva!,"My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights in a suite. The property is very lovely, surrounded by gardens and situated above lake Geneva. The room quality was superb and the staff were gracious, friendly and very responsive. We had room service (breakfast and dinner) on the terrace of our room which was magical. The hotel bar has a very hip vibe and is a great place to grab a cocktail and people watch. A late Lunch at the Cafe outside on the terrace is a must. Cozy chairs and couches covered in lamb skins with blankets to keep the chill off on a winter afternoon are the perfect touch. The only negative I can mention is that there is construction going on in front of the hotel BUT I only noticed it when I arrived and departed. ",
Historic charm and excellent service,"We stayed for a weekend at the Beau Rivage just to relax. The site of the hotel is spectacular right on the lake. The architecture is a site by itself, the historic building is beautifully preserved but at the same time has all modern comfort. We loved strolling through the hotel hallways and looking at the historic letters and pictures on display that talk about the magnificent history of the Beau Rivage. We stayed in room 555 which faced the lake on the upper floor. The room was very beautiful and elegant but at the same time we felt very much at home and cosy. I especially loved the huge comfy bed and spacious bathroom including tub. What really stood out at the Beau Rivage though was the attentive and authentically friendly staff. From checkin at reception to the team at",
So Beautiful !,"This hotel was highly recommended by a friend and did not disappointed us. We booked for 2 nights and decided to stay for an extra two. The room was spacious, comfortable and so cozy that it was difficult to leave it. The bathroom has a hidden tv mirror. Bulgari products. The Spa is very good and the staff very friendly. Valet parking The whole place is amazing. Highly recommended.",
Amazing,"I’m a frequent guest in this hotel, and this hotel on my opinion the best hotel in Lausanne by far. And my every experience in this hotel is an remarkable experience, but this time I was a bit disappointed in the lounge bar, we were waiting for an hour of our mains, which is too long for the lounge bar. But the rooms ( in the new building) are amazing, as well as the cleaning in this hotel is also amazing. You have an amazing open pool (not heating), tennis courts and the park, so if you have a family and you want to spend 500 a night, this is a must go, a perfect place for romantic and family stay-overs. ",
the best swiss hotel ever! can't wait to come again!,"As soon as we strolled up to the front door of this grand-looking hotel we knew we were going to have an amazing experience for the next two days. It’s grand-looking entrance where staff rushed to help us with our heavy bags immediately made us feel special. I have stayed in many luxury hotels over the years but none like the Beau-Rivage Palace Lausanne. The service by the staff at Beau-Rivage Palace was nothing but perfect. Everyone went out of their way to make sure I had everything that I needed. We stayed in Junior Suite Palace, and we loved it! A spacious, comfortable and modern hotel room with everything we could possibly dream about. We had a writing desk (it's very important for me because I work during my trips), sitting area, coffee/tea-making station with minibar,",
One Of The Best On The Planet,We visit Lausanne often to visit our grandchildren. I actually think we go so we can stay at the Beau Rivage. The hotel just keeps getting better. The wonderful staff do everything they can to make your stay memorable and fantastic. We cannot find any flaws. Worth every Swiss franc. ,
Fantastic as usual,"I returned to this hotel with my husband for a city escape and relaxing time. Everything was perfect from the exceptional service, friendly staff to the beautiful room with an amazing view on the lake and the mountains. The breakfast was excellent with a great range of dishes, breads, eggs, pastries, We enjoyed the spa facility, with the heated swimming pool and jacuzzi. The terrace is also great, even in winter, with plaids and heaters not to be cold. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to treat themselves.",
"Top hotel, top service, top location - it doesn't get much better than this!","The Beau-Rivage Palace is truly one of the great hotels of the world and not just because of it's location or facilities, but because of the friendliness and quality of the staff. Every person we had contact with was truly happy to assist and take their time for us - you can tell that the staff is genuinely happy to work there, which cannot be said about most other hotels. This element, along with the elegant facilities, gives you an immediate sense of calm and serenity once inside. We were also charmed by a small, but very kind gesture. As we were travelling with our 7-month old daughter, we requested a baby cot. What we found in the room was a beautiful wooden baby bed, with a very cozy blanket, a stuffed toy wrapped in a nice little bag and a balloon, which she obviously",
Felt like a cozy home,Stayed for 4 nights. It was like staying at a cozy home. The view from the room was stunning as well- the river and the sun shine. Looking out the window in the morning itself was healing. It was not like a typical hotel especially in Asia. Breakfast was nice and the staff as well. I would definitely like to stay here during my many business trips.,
The Bar was a nice refuge after walking and sight seeing,The Bar is on the street level of this high end hotel ... we were dressed for outdoor walking and exploring Ouchy (blue jeans and sweaters) yet the staff was welcoming when we asked if we could come in for drinks to talk about our day’s adventures ... a very nice venue to enjoy the ambiance of a classic bar with excellent cocktails and a fine wine list ... suggest dressing up if returning later in the evening and can picture this as a location for couples to have a drink before or after dinner ,
Perfect luxury service,I stayed at this gorgeous hotel in December for a long weekend for my sister's graduation and I was completely impressed by the extremely high level of service. I'm not sure if it is because of all the hotel school around the area but there was never an interaction with a member of staff which was not faultless. I had a lovely lake-view room (recently renovated) in the West building. I saw a room in the East building and it wasn't as nice and new. The spa and fitness room are also very good. Great breakfast buffet.,
A Palace by the Lake,"I stayed at the Beau Rivage for 10 nights this winter. Lausanne is not known as a Winter destination. So, obviously, this was a business trip. The hotel overlooks Lake Geneva and I believe it is the best hotel in the town. It is quite old, some parts of the hotel were renovated. I got lucky that I stayed in the renovated part. There is one elevator that serves the renovated section. The room design was nice. However, the room was quite small (even for 1 person). The bathroom has a walk in shower (no bath). To access the hotel form the lake side, you will need to take an elevator to the mezzanine level then take 15-18 steps to the ground floor (an escalator might be a good idea from lake level to the ground level). Breakfast room is quite specious and has beautiful views and",
Amazing Beau Rivage Palace!,"A quick weekend getaway to see the Christmas markets led us to the Beau Rivage Palace in Lausanne. This hotel is a quick 45min train ride from Geneva Airport in the beautiful lakeside town of Lausanne. What a fabulous, warm welcoming hotel with extraordinary staff! The hotel offered us a free metro ticket to explore the town and the next day we were back on the train for a 20min ride to another lakeside city, Montreux. Beautiful resort, fabulous food and we didn't even get to the 2*restaurant on site. You'll love it anytime of year!",
Beauty on the lake,"The place is breathing of Belle Époque charm, beauty and luxury the same time. Amazing service from every single person as soon as you walk in. Very personal attention from everyone. The only one restaurant was disappointing but everything else were superb.",
Great stay & location,"I stayed at Beau-Rivage during a business trip in Lausanne. The room was really spacious and beautifully decorated and overlooked beautiful Lake Léman. The staff at the hotel was very welcoming, the service provided was great and the breakfast served would cater for all tastes.",
Luxury on the lake,This is one of the most luxurious hotels we have stayed in everything about this hotel oozes comfort and attention to detail. Staff are obviously well trained and attentive. Great ambiance is all around and judging by the signed photos all around of the worlds great and good this is an opinion that is shared.,
spectacular stay,"I am very impressed with the great service at the Beau Rivage hotel. The staff at the hotel were very welcoming, I had a spacious room with an outstanding view of lake Geneva. The food was delicious . I hope I could repeat this enjoyable experience again.",
Relaxing spot and great historic feel!,"Perfect for chilling, enjoying the spot, the food and the spa. Subtle luxury also in the service. Very close to the lake and the Olympic museum. Balanced mix between old luxury style and modern touch.We will be back.",
"Excellent hotel, greate location, and above expectations",When it was recommended to me I was not expecting an outstanding but it certainly was. Staff ane very friendly and helpful. Location absolutely greate and worth the stay. Worth to point out that I stayed in the renovated part of the hotel and not the old part.,
Phenomenal,"This is 5 star at it's best, from the grand entrance, beautiful artwork, flawless service & breathtaking views over the gardens, to the trully astounding rooms. This place it huge you can not help to be impressed ",
A Superb Experience,"We went to the Beau Rivage for Anne Sophie Pic's restaurant and stayed a night. We had our dog and they had even put a water bowl in the room for him. The beds are amazing. rarely have I slept so well!! A wonderful experience, excellent service and an overall relaxing and luxurious time.",
Great hotel,It was a great pleasure to stay in this beautyful hotel. We enjoyed the Spa and the outdoor Swimmingpool even it was November. The breakfast was delicious. The lication is great. Clise to the lake and metro which takes you immediately to the centre and to the gare. ,
Exceptional hotel with unique location,"Unique and calm location with a splendid view to the park, the Geneva Lake and the Alps. Hotel, service and surroundings are second to none. Restaurants and bars for any exclusive taste, in- and outdoor swimmingpools and tastefully furnished rooms. Definitely a place to revisit.",
Wow Wow Wow!,What a Grand Hotel. While Expensive it is worth the money. We had a lake view room and again worth the cost. The room was the best maintained and decorated I think I have ever had the pleasure of using. The faint blue color walls were so wonderful. The bathroom was over the top with amenities and design. The public areas were grand and you can spend the day sitting and watching guests from all over the world. There are no faults with this hotel. ,
excellent hotel and location,outstanding customer service and location ! You will enjoy the view on the lake and very good potential for nice runs outside going on the left side of the Riviera . Try the Anne Sophie Pic restaurant where you will have an amazing moment and even discover nice Swiss wines !!! A place to go again and rest.,
What an excellent Meal at the LOBBY LOUNGE!,"The lobby lounge and its terrasse has excellent location and Lake Geneva view and food quality with various choices that suit every taste and all ages. But the only thing that makes all of the above-mentioned advantages felt is the professional staff, Mr. Jordan. His friendly attitude forces you to appreciate everything he does. He seems to love his job that he does it with true pleasure. He will go out of his way to get you what you are looking for just to add a smile on your face. If you are lucky that he is your waiter, he will make your meal service an unforgettable experience. Congratulations to Beau-Rivage Palace on recruiting such a talented staff that adds a positive note on your guests' experience at your hotel.",
Swiss landmark,"This hotel has been the place where history been made many time in last century, the hotel is definitely the best 5 star hotel in Lausanne ( probably the best in Switzerland) The building looks magnificent , with great Lobby area The check in was smooth and the duty manger was standing in the front disk he Welcome us and give us upgrade to one of The biggest suites i ever been in . The suite: acutely I don't no what exactly the call this suite because they have so many types of suites which come in every size & shape , however, the suite have 2 entrance , large room with large bath room With bvlgari amenities. And huge living room which consists of beautiful seating area enough for at least 8 people, working desk and very big dinner table for 12 people , also second bathroom",
The Ritz lives up to it's name!,This hotel stay was part of a trip that I won through my company. What a beautiful hotel and the location is fabulous! If you have a large group the bar tenders can get overwhelmed but all in all it was lovely place!,
Beautiful Lausanne,Myself and my partner spent 3 fantastic nights at the Beau Rivage Palace Lausanne. The hotel is set directly on the lake and has spectacular views of the Alps. Our room was tastefully decorated and had a gorgeous view of the lake & Alpes. There is an amazing selection for the breakfast buffet plus you can also order from the a la carte menu. We also ate in the Lobby Bar which was also very good. I would definitely stay here again.,
Beautiful Views and a great location in Lausanne,"I spend many many days staying in top Leading Hotels of the World. I have to be honest that Beau Rivage did not really wow us, although the service was exemplary and I would like to mention Jonathan ( The English/French) concierge who was really helpful. There was not that much warmth about the hotel. Possibly because it is such a large hotel. The statues in the hall I think should go and replace them with beautiful flower arrangements! ( This is a very personal view!) Our room ( 128 ) was very comfortable but we were surprised that there was no tea or coffee making facilities in our room. All the Leading Hotels that we have stayed in have Expresso machines, a kettle with complimentary tea and coffee. We did not use the Spa so I cannot comment on it. We only had breakfast one",
A superb short trip,"We went to this amazing hotel with breathtaking views of Lac Leman. We had heard many good things about this hotel, but nothing that would prepare us for how beautiful this place is. The hotel is faultless, with the service and cuisine impeccable. There is nothing that is too much trouble for them. The restaurants, which include a brasserie, a Japanese establishment, terrace light food, and of course, Anne Sophie Pic, offer more than you need. The rooms with the lake view have the most wonderful outlook. they are furbished beautifully. i don't think i can remember more tastefully designed rooms. I cannot say how impressed i was.",
Spectacular,"The hotel is unbelievably lovely and exceeded all expectations. The view of the lake from my room was breathtaking. Watch the sun rise over the lake was a perfect way to start each day. The hotel staff was professional and friendly. My room was wonderful and came with a sauna, which was unexpected. I would definitely come back for vacation. ",
By the lake,"I attended a work seminar in this lovely hotel in October 2017. This is the perfect place for business events as it gives so many possibilities for meetings, conferences and meals. The quality of the food was excellent. They serve French-style modern cuisine.",
Spectacular hotel and exemplary customer service,My wife and I stayed here after a nice stay at Geneva at the Mandarin Oriental. It was a great surprise as it really transcended our expectations. Firstly the palace is architecturally quite impressive and the accommodations spacious and the views just sublime. It is part of the fine hotels & resorts program and that meant that the staff had pride in their work and it was evident with every interaction. We were warmly welcomed and the transition from our car to the room was seamless. Charlotte (front desk) and Jonathan (head concierge) were simply fantastic- true professionals who ensured that our stay was comfortable and immensely enjoyable. We were personally escorted to the room. It was a very beautifully decorated room with an equally beautiful vista over the lake. The,
As expected...,"The Beau-Rivage is all of what you would expect from a classic old school Grand-Hotel. The location is at the lake and probably hard to find anything better in Lausanne. Great service although slightly arrogant. The rooms are nicely refurbished and sizewise ok. Try to stay away from the elevators - the hotel service access is next to them and service staff create some noise. Best, try to get a room facing the lake. The Spa is well equipped with in- and outdoor pool. Also gym (rather small) - if the hotel is heavily utilized there can be waiting times. Breakfast ist probably the best in town. Vast selection of cold and hot food and also healthy selection. In case the weather permits, there is wonderful seating outside with a view onto the lake. All of the restaurants are good.",
Excellent experience,One of the best hotels in the world. We were very impressed both with the hotel & staff. Gorgeous view on the Lake Geneva and the Alpes. Everything was just perfect. We would recommend to stay in this hotel.,
Very nice hotel with excellent service,"I stayed there for one night only and I was sorry to leave ! Gorgeous view on the lake from the corner suite I was kindly upgraded to! The bedroom is extremely comfortable with excellent bed and very soft bed linen, huge sofa, desk facing the view, plus details that make life easier such as many plugs located where you need them, large dressing and many closets, elegant bathroom, etc. No way to find any negative comment 5th floor is extremely quiet and cosy. I would recommend having breakfast in the room rather than going down to the breakfast room that is very busy and therefore somewhat noisy. I will certainly be back anytime I need to stay in Lausanne",
Top of the tops,"Just about nothing to say negative about this hotel. Amazing how a great hotel has stayed great all theee years. Very high end andvworth every penny. Located on lake shore front so easy for strolling all day. 2 blocks from metro. So convient to everything including train station. And dont use the little door chain lock. Very tricky to undo if needing to get out of room in emergency. I suggest you to get the largest room without breaking the bank. One important item i hope an improvement is made is there are not any safety grab bars around the enormous tub, at least in my recently updated room. And one minor point. Listen carefully to person who escorts you to your room especialy about heating and lighting fixture procedures. Tricky. Also take the breakfast buffet option with",
Looking for a Wonderful Hotel in Lausanne - this is it.,"Excellent from first arrival to departure. Service was first class and personalized. Location is perfect for views, but also for easy access to local attractions in Switzerland and France. Ann Sophie Pic restaurant (2 Michelin stars) is absolutely memorable.",
Fantastic,"Wow! What a fantastic hotel, this was the 2nd night of a driving holiday the hotel is opulent yet understated, pure elegance our twin room was absolutely beautiful, light and airy with gorgeous fresh flowers with a fantastic view over the lake, the staff were so accommodating and helpful nothing was too much trouble, bar prices were expensive but I suppose that's to be expected in such an establishment I would highly recommend this hotel and just a shame we were only here for 1 night ",
Old school luxury,"This hotel embodies the Belle Époque, grand and stately, beautiful grounds and unbridled luxury. Our room was spacious and the bathroom was luxurious with great amenities, a full tub and a separate balcony. The hotel is expensive, as is much of Switzerland, but the location makes it an ideal place to see Lausanne without being part of the cacophony of the big city. Ouchy is quaint and easier to manage. Staff at hotel were courteous and charming. The views of the lake were unparalleled. Breakfast was amazing, fresh and much variety. We had an early train on our last day so they gave us an to-go box so we could pack for the train. Thank you for a wonderful experience.",
Wonderful Experience at the Beau Rivage Lausanne,"The service, staff, and facilities were outstanding. Our room was one of more beautiful and comfortable we have experienced in all the years of our travel. The decor was very tasteful and unique. The food and beverages were pricy which I probably should have expected. We traveled with a group of four. Some of the dishes at the restaurants visited were excellent, some were not up to expectations given the pricing. I would nevertheless highly recommend this property.",
Road trio,"Stayed at the hotel for two nights on way back from lake Como to Calais. The hotel is very clean, the staff are helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and the bathroom was particularly well appointed with new fixtures and fittings. The shower is superb. The food is of a high standard and very enjoyable. The car park is small and you run the risk of getting boxed in. That said the hotel quickly got other guests to move to let us out. Strangely the hotel has no bar, so all drinks etc are bottled no draft beers whatsoever. I settled on the white German beers which is ok. Had a very pleasant stay, would return and happy to recommend.",
Excellent Stay.,Beautiful room with nice view of lake. It was nice relaxing room. Execellent service. Bathroom function was very nice. Can see the view of lake and mirror change to TV was relaxing. Breakfast was very good. ,
Great Property in idyllic location,"A very pleasant surprise, the Beau-Rivage is obviously a grand dame of Swiss hospitality with grand interiors and a history to match but it also has very tastefully designed contemporary interiors, a modern bar, the best Sushi I've found in Lausanne and a very good breakfast. There service is polite and professional, perhaps not quite Mandarin Oriental level of service but excellent nonetheless. A wonderful place to stay when in Lausanne. We stayed with a six month old baby and the staff were very supportive (in room setup and in the restaurants).",
Wonderful,"This is truly a gem of a hotel nestled on the edge of the lake. The service was smooth and friendly from beginning to end. Cosy bar, pretty terrace, well tended spa and pool. The newly refurbished rooms are extremely pretty, go for the lake view. The hotel staff completely spoilt my two small children, sending them up a surprise afternoon tea in the room, and letting them dress up as concierges to hand out keys for an hour while we enjoyed champagne at the bar. The breakfast was perfect too. We will be back soon. Thanks to Anais and all the lovely staff who found my lost cashmere jumper and returned it to me. ",
Exceptional service ! Rare luxury Palace A must if you are around.,"We were there a bit last minute with my wife ... not celebrating anything ! I knew the hotel from a previous business conference but of course, it is very different when you're just enjoying. Many celebrities were around, for some reason. The bar is great, terrasse and garden are fantastic, the SPA 5 Mondes is exceptional. We have not tried Anne Sophie Pic restaurant, as we have been in Valence before, and instead we went to the the exceptional place of Hotel de Ville, Viollier in Crissier, just 15mn drive from the hotel. The swimming pool is large and in/out, which is great. We had a very large suite overlooking the lake, modernly furnished, which was also a nice surprise. More than anything, we enjoyed very much the kindness of all staff. One little point was that the",
The best hotel in europe,"Staff, rooms, ambience, facilities, restaurants, food quality and variety, kids friendly all was amazing. The spa and gym were well equipped. The hotel location is superb. I recommend this hotel to everyone who is looking for a unforgettable experience.",
You always has to remember them your statut with LHW the breakfast service is poor and during our stay no hot water,The breakfast service and food was poor Same for restaurant . Room service food no taste at all. We were not recognize as LHw member always to remind them .. no hot water in bathroom Welcome gift wasnt provided we had to remind them . The room hasnt soundproof we were listening all night the other room ,
Wow,"We stayed 5 nights at this wonderful hotel. One of, if not the nicest hotel at which we haver ever stayed. Amazing staff, rooms, views, food. Nicely located on Lake Leman (Lake Geneva) near Montreux, Geneva, Ivoire (France), etc. Much to do in the hotel, in Lausanne (free public transit passes came with our room) and surroundings.",
The Most wonderful Experience,"The Hotel is faultless. Beautiful bright rooms, excellent staff, perfect luxury and restaurants fit for a King. If you have the budget this Hotel is exceptional in every way. Overlooking the lake it has the most superb views and is the perfect relaxation away from the crowds. All the staff are superb and are there to accommodate your every need. Most notably, Victoria, the perfect hostess with a wonderful charm way beyond her years - an absolute gem. A hotel that really is true perfection. ",
Wonderous facilities in an ideal location,beau rivage is an ideal lakeside base for exploring Lac Leman while enjoying a choice of exceptional restaurants. Every meal was a delight and Anne Sophie Pic fully justified a second visit with each of the tasting menus being distinctive and delicious. ,
The Lausanne Hotel!,"The newly renovated wing is fantastic - discreet and efficient service. Wonderful views of the lake from the suites, amenities are what you would look for in this type of establishement. Breakfast is very nice and a detour to ASP restaurant is worth a visit...",
Probably the best ever,"This hotel was clearly amazing. It might be the best hotel I have ever experienced. The service, the facility, the food were all perfect. We especially enjoyed the pool, overlooking beautiful Lake Geneva.",
Beautiful hotel in a beautiful location,"This was our second stay at the Beau-Rivage after a 10 year break. It's an absolutely wonderful hotel, with incredible attention to detail in virtually every aspect. It's beautifully located as well, and offers easy access to Geneva or the mountains.",
Perfect stay in beautiful hotel with great location,Our four night stay in this hotel was an excellent exprerience! We had a wonderful Superior Room with full lake view in Palace wing. The room's interior was lovely and the view to the lake was stunning. There were Lausanne City's fireworks launched from the lake because of the Swiss National Day and we could enjoy of it straight from our balcony. During our stay we got in every situation with the staff excellent service! The breakfast was delicious and we loved especially the fresh and sliced fruits - just wonderful! Overall our experience in Beau-Rivage Palace was just fantastic.,
The quality of the people!,"Leaving in a city crowded of 5star hotels and palace, what made the difference was the people. The skills and quality of the staff on all levels was absolutely outstanding! They make you surprisingly feel home with a high service level that comes naturally over. Congratulations! ",
"As ever, fantastic","This is our 4th trip to the Beau Rivage Palace and,as ever, the hotel is excellent with fantastic service, great food, very comfortable rooms with the enchanting lake view, and a relaxing pool area and spa A big thank you to the staff and management for maintaining 5 star plus standards and making our stay so enjoyable. This is a hotel that gets better with each visit. If possible, try and stay.",
our visit to lake geneva,"The location and quality of the hotel is great. The staff was friendly and the service was good. The price was a little more than it should be. Overall, we had a wonderful experience and will come back again.",
Shocking Experience,"After confirming my reservation by phone, I arrived to the Miyako restaurant with my partner to be told that we do not have a reservation and to come back in 30 minutes . After discussing our situation with the waiting staff, my partner and I headed to have a drink at the bar and returned to the restaurant (no apologies were extended and the staff did not bother find a solution or even escort us to the bar). The whole experience was average and was made worse by the inattention and the lack of empathy. Nothing about the service nor the food was outstanding. The reason I am writing this review is the dessert we were served. After ordering a Tirsmisu from one of the other F&B outlets (to have in Miyako), we received a portion that seemed like it was scooped by a 5 year old child.",
Stunning historical palace where the great and the good have stayed,"I have been coming to the Beau Rivage for the past 25 years and never tire of the glorious views of the lake and mountains from the terrace and the room. It is so uplifting I know it comes at a price but you are paying for an Institution where film stars and royalty have rested their heads including Charlie Chaplin; John Travolta, Keanu Reeves; various European and world royalty; sporting stars like Pele. All great company. I stayed in a lake view junior suite with stupendous views from the two balconies. Bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom well equipped. Service was excellent. Breakfast buffet was a feast fit for a King.",
Beautiful Palace Horrible Service,"Lets start on a good note. The palace is located at one of the most beautiful spot in Lausanne and the building looks amazing. The rooms and all common areas are stunning to look at and the lawns are picture perfect. The Hotel is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful I have stayed in. Room service food & presentation gets 10/10 Now the downfall starts right from the doormen. The staff here is lousy and most of them are trainees so don't expect good service. ""good morning"" ""good afternoon"" doesn't exist in the hotel staff dictionary. The staff at the lobby bar is rude and doesn't even know the basics of serving drinks and would pass inappropriate racial comments on guests. Breakfast buffet is served in clumsy dishes and fruit bowls have been scratched black by cutlery. Even the",
Best Hotel Experience Ever,"My family and I stayed at the Beau Rivage Palace as my sister's wedding was being held at the hotel. We had a room in the Palace Wing, which I personally preferred to the other wing as it seems more modern. The room was absolutely beautiful. In fact, the entire hotel and its grounds were breath-taking and impressive, to say the least. The staff at the Beau Rivage were very warm and helpful, making our stay that much more enjoyable. This hotel is very expensive but if you have the opportunity to stay here, you should definitely do it. It is the experience of a lifetime!",
"Overrrated, Overpriced, To Be Avoided","They say that you never get a second chance to make a first impression. This saying could not be more suitable for any location than for the Beau Rivage Lausanne. This hotel was recommended to us a couple of years ago by friends from France who really know the hotel business. Well, things must have changed since they stayed here last time. Everything started in Geneva, where the rental car we booked was not available and we got a car of a lesser category instead. When we arrived at the hotel, the bellboy totally ignored us and neither opened the door for me (the lady) or helped with our luggage. Instead, he ushered to a Porsche which pulled up behind us and courteously greeted the newly arrived guests. When we checked in, the receptionist handed us an enveloped and checked my",
Typical Swiss Service and Cleanliness,"Definitely worth the money. Also a great place for cocktails on the veranda. Lunch is great too. Although, it's kind of impossible to get a bad meal in Switzerland. The rooms are Impeccable and clean. Great location, great decor. Outstanding service. Room is spacious for a European hotel. The view is picturesque.",
Superb lake retreat,Certainly one of the best resorts in Europe perfectly positioned in front of the Lake. The property is immaculately maintained and include so many facilities for a great Summer experience. The newly refurbished accommodations are very gorgeous. The best part of hotel may be their members of staff who call you by your name and who do their outmost to please you in every way. Congratulations to all !,
Διαμονή στην Λωζανη / Stay in Lausanne,"Probably one of the best hotels one can find in Switzerland. Great service and amazing breakfast is just few of the things that come to my mind when I recall my stay there. Some say that the location is not ideal, but Lausanne is a very small town and the property provides great view and makes it easy if you want to walk / jog by the Lake.",
The most Ill-Mannered and rude concierge!!,"I often go to BRP and enjoy the beautiful breakfast and terrace they have. However, recently I had such a terrible experience with the concierge that it left me both in shock and upset. ""Laurent Etienne"" from the concierge puts les Clefs d'Or to shame. I have written them as well as I believe it should be impossible to encounter such a rude man at a 5-star hotel. I asked him about the parking, and if it was complimentary as we had dined at their restaurant. Instead of just telling me ""no unfortunately not"", he laughed and acted as if I was stupid. After our conversation, when my friend and I left, we were so upset by the way we were treated that I called the hotel to ask his name. He picked up the phone and once again he spoke to me like I was stupid. I cannot believe this man",
Very good but a little impersonal,"This is a magnificent grand old property in a beautiful location. Staff couldn't really be faulted and for five nights we enjoyed a lake side corner suite. Food was excellent So why not five stars? Well, a few reasons. It's expensive so one's expectations are high but somehow it didn't quite get there. It's a large hotel and the personal touch was missing (previous hotel the General Manger greeted us and was there to say farewell!). While we enjoyed a suite, it was effectively a large bedroom with extra beautiful furniture whereas other hotels had a separate living room. Room was made up at odd times, often 2pm and 9pm (despite our having a 10 year old daughter",
Fabulous Lake Front hotel,"Just couldn't take my eyes away from the view. Relaxed hotel, surprisingly given its size. Staff were fantastic. Highly recoommend. Lake front view rooms worth the extra. And rooms on the lower floors as the best for balcony space. Thank you Beau Rivage Palace!",
without a doubt the best hotel we ever tried,"Beau Rivage is without a doubt one of the ultimate luxury hotel we ever tried. Every detail is perfect. Service is impeccable and courteous. We had the most delightful holiday. New wing is beautiful but they should consider offering espresso machines in all rooms, its pretty standard Nowadays ",
Highly recommend.,"This hotel far exceeded our expectations. The hotel and facilities look nice on the website but they really have a wow factor that online photos cannot relay. Fabulous, friendly service in a beautiful ambiance; we enjoyed every minute of our 5 day stay. ",
Daughter's Summer Camp Drop Off,Beautiful family hotel with outstanding customer service. The view Of the lake is splendid and the variety of restaurants is rich. Accessibility to beautiful walks along the lake side is very convenient. Programs for children to participate in building hospitality know how as well as fun are world class. I loved their Cinq Mondes Spa offering memorable treatments.,
Royal Rendezvous at Lausanne,"The Headquarters at Lausanne! Beau Rivage Palace is absolutely spectacular. Beautifully located across the lake and next to the Olympic Museum. Its a massive hotel, still the service is impeccable. Excellent restaurants and beautiful lawns. Probably the largest hotel in Switzerland. The lake facing rooms are not to spacious but beautifully appointed with a traditional look but still modern and fresh. An absolute delight to stay here. ",
Honeymoon,"Honeymooned here in 2009 - wonderful suite with jacuzzi, balcony and lake view - simply stunning! Excellent silver salvor room service. Excellent customer service. Delightful restaurants to select from - ate at the Japanese restaurant a number of times and also at Anne Sophie Pic - unbelievable cuisine. Fabulous hotel- an experience never to be forgotten! - sorry for delay in writing this review. ",

Luxury luxury luxury,"Simply amazing. Luxury throughout the hotel, from the rooms to the spa and most importantly, the staff. They are professional, hospitable and very friendly to children. Pricey for sure but worth every penny. We almost didn't want to leave our rooms for our 3 days there!",
Old fashioned glamour,"Two day work trip to stay next to Lake Geneva was never going to be a particularly hard offer to agree to, but the opportunity to stay in this stunning hotel made it impossible to turn down. A real throwback to how a 5* hotel used to be, b ut with enough modern touches to make it relevant to today's luxury traveller. The rooms were very comfy if a little on the small side, but the impeccable communal areas, fantastic breakfast and decadent mahogany-clad lift more than compensated for that. Having an actual key and fob as opposed to a card to access your room is a nice touch too. The only down side was the extensive work being done at the front of the hotel which meant that you didn't get the full impact upon arrival, but that was a small price to pay and work needs doing at any",
"Amazing, but a few little things went wrong...","My stay at the Beau-Rivage Palace was amazing. The hotel was very decorative with nice wallpaper, nice chandlers, nice carpets, etc.. As soon as I walked in I knew this was a very nice, and gourmet hotel, just by looking at it. I went straight up to my room after a good check in with nice staff. Someone gave us a tour around the whole place and a explanation of the rooms and the area. The room I had was water front view of Lake Geneva, and a really good and clear view of the French mountains across from the lake. The room had very comfortable beds and a large variety of pillows. What I mean by that is they gave you a list of what pillows they had. I don't remember some of them but one was a stress reliever one was a feather pillow, one was a allergy free pillow, and they had a",
Excellent,A true Grande Damme that welcomes even the youngest guests with balloons and macaroons on arrival. Fabulous if you've been caught up in a BA nightmare. Thank you Beau Rivage Palace and especially to Alex on Concsierge ,
Luxury hotel,To be honest this hotel has outstanding service and a very high standard of quality offerings. It can do a lot better for the modern traveller though- no tea or coffee service in the room. Has to be asked for and then get charged for it as well. Please stop charging for tea and coffee you charge us enough for the rooms anyway.,
Relaxing Weekend,"Excellent location, just in front of the lake. Great private park with summing pool. Ideal to relax on the lake and enjoying the local area and food. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Hotel staff is really warm and open to support any requests. The hotel has a wide choice of restaurants.",
Remarkable,"Very lovely place to go-everything just perfect! Staff extremely helpful and friendly, food lovely, cocktails amazing, and the views! A bit pricey, but it is more than worth it. Just exceptional-would highly recommend! They do go that extra mile for everyone and its an experience everybody should get.",
Where everything goes right and more,"If you are touring Switzerland and if the Swiss Riviera is part of your agenda, your first stop has to be Ouchy at the Beau Rivage. The Beau Rivage is truly the embodiment of a Swiss Palace. Its location by the shore of the Lake of Geneva, a few meters from the Olympic Museum and from the port where steamers berth before heading to Evian, to Montreux, to Geneva, cannot be bettered. Please, choose a lake facing room (do not ask for a full ocean view though, Switzerland is a landlocked country) and enjoy a landscape captured best by Ferdinand Holder. Enjoy the famous Symmetric reflection of the Alps all deep blues and purples at sunrise in the silvery mirror of the lake .Do not worry, your host thoughtfully added the mandatory green line at the bottom of the picture thanks",

Landolt's elegance breathes through,"A great amongst the great classic hotels. It use to be my favorite, as I must have stayed here over 2 months in total days over the last 4 years.

In a class by itself !,"Perfect location: away from the city center by yet within walking distance of it in a beautiful green setting, facing the Lake and quiet. A grand Palace with modern features! Spacious rooms nicely decorated, neither old-fashioned nor too modern with soft and eye-pleasing colors and all the comfort that one would expect of a 5-star hotel. Superb choice of restaurants and an airy breakfast room full of natural park with view over the park. Polite, courteous and anticipative staff members! What a great hotel. No doubt, one of the best in the world. You must experience it! ",
Simply the best in the world !,"if you wish to stay in what , in my opinion, is quite simply one of the best hotels in the world with captivating alpine and lakeside views then visit Hotel Beau Rivage Palace. The service is second to none, the ambience is perfect and the quality of food sublime !",

Hotel with perfect score,"There is no negative comments as the hotel is flawless, perfect in every way. They make you feel welcome the minute you step into the hotel, everyone from door bell staff to reception staff to chamber maids.",
Gorgeous ballrooms,One of the most beautiful ballrooms this hotel has it. Rooms are beautiful but not impressive and housekeepers do not speak much english. However staff is willing to help and seems very nice. Worth staying if you are in Lausanne.,
Lovely Hotel on the Water,This is a great choice in Lausanne if you want to be right on the lake and still have easy access to the city. The hotel provides a metro pass so you can easily visit the city. Rooms are large and well appointed. Service is outstanding and prices are high for food and drink.,
Amazing Hotel,"Beau Rivage is a beautiful hotel. It is very elegant. There are Michelin Star restaurants at Beau Rivage. It is very quiet and peaceful. The hotel is very family-friendly, as there is also a petting area for rabbits and various activities for kids to do as well, such as baking. I sent my kid to have a baking class in the beautiful hotel's kitchen. The pastry chef was very friendly and helpful and showed my kid how to make cookies and cakes. That was one of the highlights of the hotel, as it made my kid very happy. ",
Very good hotel in Lausanne,"Very classic Hotel in Lausanne, very ancient decoration but to very high standards Room very spacious, very nice dressing area, very nice bathroom with separate shower and bath tube. Amenities top level. Excellent views to the lake ( not from the room I took ), oustanding breakfast buffet. Personnel very friendly and attentive. Very good hotel for business meetings, very nice conference rooms and outstang food in the buffets. Remember that lake side hotels in Lausanne mean long walk to the city center, which is quite uphill ( public transport available ).",
"The Hotel is wonderful, the Concierge service makes it exceptional","Beau Rivage is a really pleasant surprise. All rooms seem to overlook the lake of Lausanne and are very confortable. The property is beautiful and big. I like the breakfast buffet, you can get whatever you want and it is all good. The highlight of the hotel is SYLVIE the Concierge. Over the top! Silvie arranged for us hikes on various mountains, a bike trip with a local guide, dinner reservations, etc.... Sylvie made our experience very special.",
First Class,"The Beau-Rivage Palace is a truly outstanding hotel. Everything is simply perfect, location, friendliness of staff, facilities, restaurants, bar.

"Easter 2017 - BRP best assets - its people in front Sylvie, breakfast Joanna / Romina, room service and wellness Manbuly","Time is really scarce these days, so tend to write reviews only when the experience is exceptional and indeed our stay in BRP was. We spent a lovely 3 days at beau rivage palace in lausanne for 3 of us and a little white bishon, where we had a nice package deal for 2 nights over easter 2017, weather was sunny first day and cloudy the other 2 but becausse the hotel had pool and wellness we had options to cover inclement weather. We were in room 470 which was brilliant. Although, would have been perfect if we were on the lake side, as views are superb but forgot to request an upgrade. Anyway the room service is really worth mentioning, as we came over easter, we had easter eggs on our pillow, in a basket for our 15yo daughter and a large egg to our surprise and complimentary",
My Favourite Hotel in Lausanne,"Is it always a great pleasure to stay at this hotel. The Hotel staff are all very kind & helpful, the location fantastic, and lake facing rooms are gorgeous. There are many beautiful hotels around the ""Lac Leman"" but this hotel is one of the best. Just enjoy your stay!",
Historic grand hotel overlooking Lake Geneva!,There's a reason heads of state choose this hotel: its history is rich and it's refurbished to its original grandeur! Many guests visiting us in this region have stayed there and all say impeccable service matches magnificent location and fantastic restaurants on location. It's also walking distance from Ouchy port at the base of Lausanne on Lake Geneva.,
For high class guests!,"Beau-Rivage it is a Palace. From my room, I had a lake view and in combination with the amazingly decorated and spacious room, I created amazing memories. Unfortunately, accidently I dropped my phone in the lake and the memories are printed in my mind. So, I think soon I will visit it again and I hope this time to bring my phone with me and share with you the excellence of this hotel. If you think to book it or not, book it and I allow you to call me a lier if you can find something negative to mention.",

Great hotel,"Very good location, very clean! Great service! We had a room service for lunch. We didn't have time to eat everything we ordered. We left the untouched food on the table hoping to be back in 50 minutes and finish our lunch and drinks. When we returned the room was clean and our untouched food and drinks were gone! Maybe we had to leave a note? We didn't report this to the hotel and instead went for a dinner. In general, this hotel is very nice and we will not hesitate to come back. Great experience! ",
Fantastic weekend in Lausanne,"True to it´s promises! FANTASTIC is the word!Everything is luxury, room, restaurants, food, service, staff, surroundings. Even the weather was good! An extra plus for breakfast buffé!Also the view was AMAZING! Made our trip to Lausanne unforgettable.",
Amazing Hotel with a fantastic room,"This is a seriously top notch 5 star hotel. You cannot go wrong staying here. The staff all spoke English and did everything I can think of to make the stay very easy. The price on everything is very expensive, so if that is part of your consideration you may not want to stay here. However, if you can afford it, you will be getting something for all the money. I stayed in the newly renovated section, which I have to say was really the best if not the second best hotel room I've ever had the pleasure of staying in.",
In the Seventh Heaven,"Beau-Rivage Palace is one of the best and for me personally THE best hotel – palace where I had a lucky chance to stay. It has a fabulous location – on the shores of Lake Geneva in the middle of vast blossoming gardens and facing the snowy peaks of majestic Alps. At the same time it is very near to the city centre. Even though it opened its doors more than 150 years ago it looks very fresh, gracefully combining traditional values, exquisite chic and contemporary developments. Recently the hotel had been fully refurbished. The rooms have different design but all very spacious (from 30 to 140 sq.m). I had a pleasure to stay in the room in light blue and beige colors with soft carpet, absorbing all unnecessary sounds, large French window, facing the lake, and a huge bathroom with",
Stunning design throughout hotel,I attended a reception at le Beau-Rivage Palace for the Young Hoteliers Summit and was taken aback by the design and meticulous planning that was put into the building's layout. From the interior to exterior it was walking friendly and absolutely stunning. The serving staff were exceptional and the food was delicious. I never felt like I was looking for something to eat as I often do at other banquets and receptions. Thank you for such an amazing experience in Switzerland!,
Beau-Rivage,"One of the finest hotels in the world. from the reception desk on checking in to departure, a grade A experience, I am planning on taking my family there. It sets on the shores of Lake Geneva and is a magnificent structure. the hotel has been remodeled and compares to any other hotel in the area. highly recommend to anyone",
"Amazing hotel, great location","Splendid hotel Great spa Great food (a 2 michelin star restaurant, a very good brasserie and a good Japanese) Great location (the view from the swimming pool is priceless - les Alpes + le lac Léman) Top service Highly recommended for a romantic or family trip.",
So happy to visit this hotel again!,"This is our family's favorite hotel! The service is excellent, rooms gorgeous, comfortable and well appointed (we booked 2 junior suites overlooking the lake), and food at the hotel is delicious. Breakfast buffet is a spread unlike any other. The Cafe Beau Rivage is excellent - we ate there 2 nights as we learned on our last trip to Lausanne, that this restaurant has outstanding food. Onion Soup, Cauliflower Velotte, Beef Cheeks with truffle potato espuma (insanely good!), potato gnocchi with curried sweet potato espuma - were some of our choices. You can't go wrong with this restaurant. The spa at the hotel is lovely as well - indoor/outdoor pool, hot tub, sauna, steam room plus spa treatments. The hotel is located right on Lake Geneva with stunning views of the French",
Great place but a bit old equipment,"I came in late for interviewing some candidates the next morning. It was past midnight. Wth no hope of finding food in a country like Switzerland I was pleasantly surprised when the kitchen fixed me some hot and cold food which delicious. The kitchen manager, who I think was from malaysia was just a pleasure to deal with. In the morning it was absolutely lovely to soak the beautiful ambiance, the clean air and the elaborate breakfast setting. Too bad I didn't have time to stay more. The only thing that separates me from giving them a compete 5 star is that the TV, the phone and other electronics were old and dated. For a person who travels a lot this stuck as odd and I think they should modernise / digitise a bit more Would love to stay there with my wife for a romantic",
Fabulous,"Unfortunately we didn't have the pleasure of staying in this fabulous hotel. But we were incredibly lucky to be able to use its facilities, we were able to enjoy a fab drink in one of the bubbles on the front lawn, service was first class and it was a great experience ",
Gorgeous property with amazing service,This was our second visit in the last two years - the service is impeccable and the rooms are superb, every single detail has been thought of - and obviously this is a very well managed property. Their breakfast is one of the best !!
Outstanding hotel,"Stayed for 4 nights for an event, could not have chosen a better hotel. Was upgraded to a deluxe room, which was huge which a sitting area and large views of the park at the side of the hotel. The bars and restaurant are absolutely stunning, loved the breakfast area which has fantastic views, and we also ate at Anne-Sophie Pic (fabulous) and The Lobby Lounge, plus I attended a banquet in the ballroom. One of the best hotels I have stayed in.",
Just outstanding....,"I was just staying 1 night for business purposes but i had fabulous stay. Almost everything perfect, great reception of the staff, totally clean, excellent lake view.... only negative was the extremely high priced starters at the ""Cafe"" restaurant... But all in all to be recommended.. ",
Marvelous,"First class facilities, very comfortable, great location, staff unexcelled in performance and friendliness. Prices in bar and restaurants a bit high compared to other exclusive hotels. We will return when the weather is warmer and we can enjoy the outdoors.",
Outstanding Hotel,"A truly beautiful hotel with amazing views of Lake Geneva. First class service, great food, good restaurant choices and lovely breakfast. Room was first class. Expensive but worth it. We are definitely planning a return trip.",
Great service,Hosted a business event with30 people. Great eve in one of the rooms. Food was awesome also breakfast. Rooms are very clean but not the most modern I have seen. Service and catering was very good and responsive. Bar was the place to drink and speak informally with bus collegues.,
Not always first class,"This is a magnificent hotel with stupendous common rooms and various usually excellent restaurants - that's why when the technics guy needs 20 min to fix an annoying problem in newly renovated rooms (avoid those with the mirrors towards the bathrooms), when the headwaiter leaves as you are ordering dinner to return minutes later after doing no urgent tasks and they miss to congratulate for a birthday they have been made aware o",
"Great Venue, Awesome Food",I did not stay at the hotel but I went there for a business meal. The food is simply great. Anne Sophie Pic is just one of the best on this planet. The building is magnificent. The Staff is beyond exceptional.,
exceptionally good,One of those hotels where you immediately feel at home thanks to an overall warm atmosphere and extremely friendly staff. Room was well equipped and spotlessly clean. Will certainly come back and would certainly recommend.,
Nice and spacious hotel,Stayed for a business trip in the hotel : very spacious by swiss hotel standards and very fancy ... hotel looks and feels majestic : fabulous view in the morning while having breakfast ... very very nice and courteous staff at reception ( one person went and got a mail from the post office and deliver to me in time ) : recommended if you have the budget !!!,
Great hotel and management but need to polish service,"The experience of staying in the hotel was great although normal rooms are really too small. However, there were repeated incidents of poor service to normal requests, this is something that needs to be attended for such a high standard hotel.",
Impeccable!,"Stayed two days in the Hotel, with my son who was visiting a school campus. Everything was exactly the way you expect them to be in a 5* establishment. Just perfect: service, room, comfort, amenities, and location...and a couple good surprises like the japanese restaurant. Anecdote: when we checked in around midnight on wednesday, the receptionist handed me a pre-filled registration form... good organisation... but I was puzzled when he also said ""welcome back!""... the address on the form was a place where I lived... in NYC, 35 years ago! ...which reminded me I had been here and evidence that this hotel also has a 5* memory! ",
Excellent across the board,Excellent in all areas - The best service in Switzerland. Superb food. Will definitely be back. Location grounds and pool are wonderful and well maintained. Only thing to fix - service in the lobyy bar,
Exquisite,Stunning historical hotel with beautiful lake views. The restaurants are excellent and the building and various amenity spaces are stunning. Worth noting that some rooms have been redone and are pristine while some areas of the hotel are a little aged although still very well kept and charming. Recommend that you try get one of the newer rooms. The staff were very kind and helpful and I really couldn't have asked for anything to be better. Will certainly stay here next time I go to Lausanne.,
Absolutely stunning!,"This historic hotel is in front of Lac Leman and offers gorgeous scenery. The hotel itself is luxurious. We were in Lausanne for 1 day and got to visit Beaux-Rivage Palace. Great setup of the rooms. The staff is fantastic. We had a late lunch at the lounge. I ate a delicious quinoa salad mixed with avocado and all sorts of healthy and flavorful ingredients. The dessert was delicious and the ambiance very relaxing with a piano man playing some nice melodies. Rates are high of course, but that's expected for such a facility. ",
"Fabulous stay - pricey, but worth it.","Loved the opulence of this very tastefully styled hotel. Nice pool area and playground for the kids. They also had a kids' programme if needed. Very attentive staff wanting to make our stay seemless. Great restaurant choice. We tried the Japanese, French and lobby restaurants as well as the breakfast buffet and they were all excellent. Rooms were lovely. I'd recommend a junior suite with lake views. Definitely worth the upgrade. ",
Wonderful,"Well located, really close to the big lake, Beau-Rivage Lausanne offers the best quality all over. If you can get in summer time, terrace is a wonderful place to be maybe with live music also. The restaurant and bar, both are really good with a very good service : ) I will be back...",
One of the greatest hotels in the world,Everything at the top you can expect in a great traditional hotel. It has been recently renewed completely. The place you must be in Losanne. VIP from all over the world stayed here since 100 years. Very nice restaurants and great swimming pool ,
Beautiful,"Magnificent building, excellent food and service, beautiful and peaceful view over the Leman Lake. Everything is perfect in this legendary hotel. it's a great experience to discover Switzerland. You'll enjoy it. And I don't work for them lol :)",
fabulous,"beautiful grounds, great view of the lake, private indoor/outdoor combined heated pool , breakfast buffet one of best and well presented loved architecture inside & outside; very airy feeling we had a suite facing lake , separate living & dining room overlooked front of property highly recommend, especially if you get suite",
MAGNIFICENT,"If you are looking for a true 5-star luxury stay in Lausanne, this is the place. The hotel and room interior is impeccable. Customer service is 5-star. Front desk staff, concierge, and room service staff all speak English and were friendly, helpful, and professional. We ate at Cafe Beau Rivage (the restaurant that is part of the hotel) twice because it was so good. Note that you should make reservations in advance especially on Sat nights. The location of this hotel is superb- right on Lake Leman, with spectacular views. We were there for the Lausanne Marathon, and it was the perfect location (15 min walk to the start, and 3 min walk from the finish). I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat.",
Nice views and rooms,"I like the hotel location and the views of the lake and alps. Modern renovated rooms. Excellent breakfast selection. The poached eggs are a must try. They have good parking facilities and very attentive staff. Clean rooms, you will love the place ",
Outstanding,"The quality of the hotel, room, service and especially food can not be improved on and when the management gives up his own reservation at a recommended restaurant for us as guests that speaks to the overall quality of the hotel",
Excellent,"It's by the lake and the staff are awesome. The best hotel to book if you want true 5 star in Lausanne. They had complimentary blueberries in the room when I checked in -and after a long trip, it is all I needed!",
Stunning hotel,"Were supposed to be staying at the Movenpick, for an event with IMD, however it was overbooked and we got moved here. Wish that happened everytime. This hotel is superb, the location, facilities, cleanliness, rooms, everything about it was amazing. Highly recommend. Apart from the fact it is very expensive!",
great hotel,"Very elegant, comfortable. Very friendly and accommodating staff. My first time staying at Beau-Rivage, it is definitely a five star hotel. Very close to the lake, walking distance to the olympic park and the subway. Buffet was excellent as well.",
Great Hotel,one of the best hotels we have been to anywhere. Professional in every respect with concierge service of top caliber. We will be back to this outstanding hotel. Close to Lac Geneve with boat excursions of refined service.,
The Beau-Rivage Palace is beautiful and has an amazing staff.,"I have had the pleasure of visiting several hotels in my travels, for business and pleasure, and the Beau-Rivage Palace has to be one of the most elegant and offers some of the best service I have received. At well over 100 years old, this hotel is immaculate: the owners clearly invest a great deal of resources into maintaining and improving this beautiful property, striking the right balance of classic and updated luxury. But my favorite part of the hotel is the service: my wife and I felt welcomed from the moment we arrived. The staff members spoke exceptionally well in English or French--although my French is not nearly as good as their English. Thank you, Beau-Rivage team, for an amazing visit.",
Wondeful Hotel,Perfect hotel in great location on edge of lake. Highly attentive staff & great 5 star facilities. Surprise at how many guests had dogs with them! all good & hopefully we will be back again soon. Thanks.,
Stunning hotel!,"Lausanne is a beautiful city and it's hard to choose because there are many good hotels but the Beau-Rivage Palace is just one of the best hotels with very spacious rooms bountifully decorated with all you can think of and attention to details to make the stay present. Another great thing is the location, the level of service and the hotel facilities all top notch.",
A truly magnificent place!,"Located directly on Lake Geneva and overlooking the mountains, the BRP is a truly magnificent place be it for vacation, business gathering or just a retreat. Service is impeccable and Swiss hospitality at its best. The rooms are very spacious and beautifully decorated and just as you would expect, bathroom supplies are of top quality. Extremely comfortable beds and pillows. There are so many places in the hotel to walk around, sit down and relax and enjoy drinks, coffee, etc. Service is available everywhere. A real enjoyable place and a must.",
"Fantastic food, very nice service","We went here as we were advised by another restaurant to go here as they were fully booked and it was a very good advice!! Cannot judge the inside of the restaurant as due to the fantastic weather we had our meal outside. The terrace is large and very nice with a view of the lake. The service was simply impeccable!! The food was really very tasty, did not hear anything other than very enthusiastic responses from our group. Everything from the starters to the desert and the coffee was presented very nice! Definitely a recommended address when visiting Lausanne!!",
Top hotel in the Lake area!!!,"We spent 3 nights at this property in July and I have forgotten to write my review here, so let´s do it!! Well, the reservation was made by AMEX Platinum Travel Service, which gave us daily breakfast and late check-out up to 4pm + CHF 100 to spend at the property + upgrade (upon availability). So, by the time we arrived we were scorted by the doorman to the reception where we made our check-in. The lady at the reception was very nice and attentive. As mentioned before, upgrade was available and we were given a Deluxe Room Lake View which was great, the view from our room was fantastic!! The room is very clean and decoration is impecable!! Hotel is big and very beautiful in every detail. Breakfast is so diverse with lots of choices, delicious!! Housekeeping pays attention to",
Super place,"Everything was excellent. we are very proud to stay at such Hotel.Super place, really.Enjoy it .The meal is very delicious.Such great view from windows.Climat is very enjoyable.Hotel is very beautiful.At the reception are very friendly managers.Everybody,who works there ,are smiling and friendly helpful.we are glad that have been there for our stay.we will tell our friend about this hotel and they will recomend to theirs friends-we hope so.Thank you",
Beau Rivage Palace Lausanne,The Beau Rivage Palace is the most wonderful hotel experience. The ability to combine 5 star plus luxury while making every guest feel relaxed and welcome is something special. Everything was perfect and this is something you should try at least once. Just a pleasure having stayed.,
A lot of mixed feeling about this hotel,"This is a landmark hotel in Lausanne with a lot of history and a long list of dignitaries and royalties, who once stayed in it, but this was all in the past and I think it is unacceptable that it has the negative points that I will point out especially considering the prices they charge The good points The location is great in Ouchy overlooking the lake with very nice views The grounds and building are magnificent The rooms a huge and furniture is antique and very rich We had a nice sauna room and a Jacuzzi bath tub in our room The bad points The 4th floor gets to be very hot if the sun is up, and the air conditioning is weak and useless, you can’t even open the windows because they have a sign warring us of the mosquitos outside, and we ended up sleeping with a fan We",
One of best hotels in world,"Where can I start? The rooms were exquisitely decorated in old world style yet updated and fresh. The bathrooms seem to have been newly redone and are incredible. Make sure you ask for a room overlooking the Lake as the views are spectacular. We felt like we were in a luxurious apartment rather than a hotel room. This hotel is the epitome of elegance; from the rooms, the pool, spa, tennis courts and wide variety of restaurants. The service was impeccable and friendly. Congratulations to the owners and managers of the Beau Rivage! This is truly an incredible place.",
Very clean rooms,"hotel location is very good , all facilities are very good , rooms are very clean , Reception staff very helpful . enjoyed our stay , highly recommended . Breakfast variety very good and staff very helpful .",
"Very big, but still great",I had two lovely nights at this marvellous hotel. The reception staff were very attentive and friendly. The rooms were absolutely fantastic and very well equipped. I only visited two of the restaurants and also here the service was top. Only the service in the garden needs some fine tuning.,
Almost perfect,"It is a beautiful Belle Époque building with classic decor, professional and courteous service. The rooms are big and comfy w great sleep quality. The breakfast is of very high standard. The modern spa/gym area is a joy. The location is great next to the lake. It is a huge property with a lot of outdoor space. They are very family friendly. Kids can stay in parents' room for free which is quite rare in Switzerland. We enjoyed our weekend stay to hike the Lavaux vineyards nearby. Thanks a lot. The only thing I wasn't too happy about, which is totally not hotel's fault is that some of the senior guests are not so kids friendly. They make terrible faces and complain a lot when your kids are a bit louder in the pool. ",
"Beau-Rivage Palace, Lausanne","A superb experience with no criticism - the ultimate in hotel excellence - quality of attention to detail and the respect shown to me as a guest. I have stayed at Beau-Rivage, three times, it has maintained its quality during these three visits. If you want to feel looked after where no request is too much trouble this is the place to choose.",
Epitome of perfection,"Its hard to find fault with perfection.....I suppose the room having a ""smart"" lighting system was eternally perplexing to me, but if you were familiar, likely not an issue....I just went with it. Overall, a priceless experience, sheer luxury, worth the price for the history alone.",
A luxury hotel from another time.....,"Wonderful hotel, with very nice personnel magnificent lake view, very stylish, good service and everything you expect from a 5 star hotel. Though the bar is a bid expensive you get rewarded by the unique ambience.",
Fantastic,"We stayed here for 3 nights in August and absolutely loved it. Everything about the place oozed class and elegance from the beautiful flower arrangements to the amazing service, which was 1st class. We had a twin room on the 3rd floor which looked over the access road to the back of the hotel. It was a very good size with a really nice modern bathroom, which was also large. The room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. We both slept incredibly well. There was a mini bar in the room and complimentary still and sparkling water which was replaced each day. Apart from breakfast, we only ate once at the hotel. That was the night we arrived when we just had a bar snack in the bar area near the main reception - we both had the local perch from the lake and chips. ",
Great hotel but missing staff in restaurants,"It is a beautiful hotel. The only, but I think very important, question I regret is the poor coordination my family and I suffered in both restaurants that we attended. In Café Beau-Rivage we had to wait one hour until the food was served, and no details or any apologies about it. The maitre didn't act appropriately and the supervisor didn't show up while we were complaining. Again, next day, at the Lobby Lounge, the same. It seems they are lacking of employers to serve efficiently. I expected more professionalism due to this hotel range. Besides this, the reception staff is effective and warm, the room (bed, decoration etc) perfect. Breakfast wonderful , even they couldn't be able to give me a just squeeze natural orange juice that I kindly ordered and gave me the same",
Perfect Holiday,"Hotel hospitality, location, weather, staff professionalism and guest empathy combined with perfect dinning experience made me very eager to return. Unfortunately as a warm weather traveller I will have to wait until next year.",
Beautiful,"Everything about this hotel was beautiful. The staff were very attentive and helpful! The concierge helped plan our days and train trips. The rooms were bright, beautifully designed and comfortable! The location was great! Excellent view of lake Geneva. Lots of restaurants close by. ",
One of the best in the world,"This hotel is really one of the best in the world, I have stayed many times but also visited many times. The public areas are wonderful including the gardens which are magnificent overlooking Lac leman . All the venues for food and beverage depending what it is that you wish for are simply marvelous. There is also Ann Sopie Pic at the hotel who is one of the great chefs of the world. I very much doubt anyone would not be overwhelmed with pleasure visiting and or staying in this magnificent hotel with all its added attractions even the pool in the summer is just perfect as is the lunch.",
Elegant Hotel but Overrated,"I was a little disappointed with this hotel. Maybe my expectations were unrealistic. On the positive side, the hotel and its rooms were nicely appointed and the staff provided good service (generally speaking). The breakfast buffet and service at the restaurant was amazing. I've gotta say that the breakfast was my favorite part of the experience. The spa is very nice, too, and it was great being a relative short walk from the Metro (with one of the stops being the train station), the boat docks and restaurants/stores. But the room was missing some of the amenities I had come to expect at a 5-star Swiss hotel, such as an espresso maker and kettle (with coffee and tea). The complimentary bottled water was sort of hit and miss, and the staff didn't note the water",
Exellent service and view,Very nice hotel with excellent service and reception. Wonderful rooms with splendid lake view. The rooms are on a top standard with very nice materials. Top restaurant with top service and good food. Very friendly personel and top breakfast buffet.,
Beau Rivage Palace Lausanne,"We have had many excellent stays at the Beau Rivage Palace and all three this year were to the same high standard. There is a genuine warmth from the staff and is gratifying to see a hotel of this class that is child friendly. The Anne Sophie Pic restaurant is under rated at 2 Michelin stars, deserving 3.",
Reward Yourself,"My husband and I came to stay at the Beau Rivage after travelling from France. We were winging it, planning to explore the town of Lausanne like vagabonds and see what budget hotel had some room. Crossing through the Savoie mountains, we had car trouble. It was a Sunday. Can you imagine trying to deal with an auto emergency in the mountains of Europe on a Sunday afternoon? hint: the ordeal took hours. And then, it started raining on us. I'll spare you the details, but I can tell you, by the time we arrived in Lausanne, we were wet, grumpy, and questioning our wedding vows. As we rolled into town, we were taken aback by the magnificent structure that is the Beau Rivage sitting grandly in front of the lake. As soon as we saw it, we knew, THIS is what we needed to salvage our",
A quality accommodation,"This huge hotel is of a dying breed. Located on the lake, this resort offers true luxury -- well appointed and modern rooms in a 100-year old setting. While expensive, you get what you pay for. Staff is efficient; maybe a little stiff. Parking is convenient. Dining options are many and a mixed bag -- we most preferred the Italian Restaurant at the ""sister"" hotel. Breakfasts are very satisfying with a very wide range of selections.",
Nothing can compare,"If you are considering staying at this hotel please do not hesitate, the entire experience is just Devine, the location, the rooms, the facilities, the service is in a league of its own. The staff are all incredibly friendly, absolutely nothing is too much trouble and what is also wonderful is they are super child friendly, not often a fact true of most other hotels at this level. Our tarif included breakfast, even if you are not a breakfast fan I would urge you to make an exception as the breakfast selection is not only extensive but of a standard that reflects the quality of the Beau Rivage. When I was considering this hotel a few questions I felt weren't clearly answered on the hotel website which you may find useful: 1. Parking is plentiful and as with everything else the",
Amazing Stay,Everything and i mean everything was excellent. You name it and they have done the best in that. From minute details to the big things.. me and my family could not have asked for more better stay. me and my family were more than impressed !,
Resort with amazing Food & Beverage and Lake view,"The situation of the hotel is exceptional, service perfect, and a diner at Anne Sophie Pic is worth the trip. The grand menu is perfect, with the highlight of the seabass. I only regret that I could not stay longer to enjoy other restaurants , as well as the Spa.",
Fairy-tale Experience,"Magnificent! My wife and I had a wondrous experience at the Beau-Rivage, far better than we had anticipated, although we knew it would be special. An extraordinarily friendly and knowledgeable woman who works there -- the chargee de relations -- welcomed us. This woman is an amazing person. She treated us as if we were a visiting king and queen. She is brilliant, helpful, very nice--very special. She kindly showed us around the hotel. We also met the manager, the front desk staff, and bellboys, and they were all extraordinarily friendly and courteous. Put shortly, we were dazzled by the staff's kindness. Moreover, our room was exquisite, very beautiful; the view of Lake Geneva from our terrace was spectacular; fine details, such as the TV embedded in the mirror over the bathroom",
Sensational,"Spent a day in this fabulous hotel and I am not sure where to start from, our stay was sensational. The hotel is gorgeous, the exterior and interior are so tasteful and beautiful, it is just gorgeous. We really enjoyed the facilities, the pool area and the spa are beautiful, it was great chilling by the pool and enjoying the view of the lake and the Apls in the distance. I loved the Japanese rituals bath and massage at the spa, the staff are lovely and the facilities of the spa are among the best I've experienced. We really enjoyed the food as well. The reception serves beautiful champagne cocktails and offers fantastic views, the sushi restaurant was excellent and the main restaurant is really fantastic. It was my birthday so we enjoyed the specials on the menu, the lobster",
Late lunch ...,"Visiting Lausanne with friends - ended up having a late lunch on the patio of the hotel. Beautiful garden and surroundings. Unfortunately they have an issue with birds leaving reminders of their presence on the furniture (it is pretty much everywhere - so be careful where you sit). Might be an idea to have a person passing by ever so often with a cloth and cleaning product to follow up. This would be better than having the Maitre d' wiping the furniture with a skimpy paper napkin last minute while the guests wait. Food was great, as would be expected. Unfortunately the tables a so low it becomes a challenge ensuring not to spill food on yourself.",
A true gem,"A wonderful experience from the very beginning to the very end. True luxury and service that you will find hard to beat anywhere in Europe. We had high expectations that were met in every single way. As close to perfection as one could at a hotel in peak season. The staff are a cut above the rest! The restaurants are excellent, fabulous indoor spa and excellent outdoor pool. Location is the best in Lausanne",
Killer location but poor service,"This hotel itself is in a prime location with beautiful views of the lake. The property is absolutely stunning and well cared for inside and out. However, the service needs some work. Despite the fact that there were tons of employees on staff, they were not helpful. My husband emailed the hotel in advance to inform them of our train arrival time. When we got there @4pm, we were informed that our room was not ready. This was well past the allowable check in time. The front desk guy was polite and apologetic and installed us outside for a drink. We ordered water as we just wanted to hydrate after our long travels. This associate told us he would update us with when the room would be ready. Then he disappeared! We wait over 25 minutes with no update. We returned to the front desk",
High expectations - unfortunately not met,The entrance to the hotel is through the main gate and after passing the barrier the chasseur will drive your car to the hotel garage. Parking is available for €40 / day. The foyer and the hotel garden are beautifully set but the rooms are dated and the spa is overrated and makes a sterile impression. The breakfast and the service on the other hand is first class and makes up for the aforementioned setbacks.,
Beautiful location,"Beautiful location, just in front of the lake. Very nice pool area and spa. Comfortable spacious quite rooms, very classic with Gobelin tapestry hanging on the wall. The lighting in the bathroom could be much better. Absolutely everybody from the staff was extremely nice, welcoming and helpful. A human touch in a five star environment. Only negative points; there were many guests with dogs. I love animals, but there were far too many poorly educated small dogs for my taste. The smell of cigars and cigarettes on the terrace. It would be nice to have a separate area for smokers. ",
Incredible in every way,"My recent stay at this hotel was incredible. The property is stunningly beautiful, ideally located and luxuriously appointed. We booked a lake view room for our stay and it's well worth the added cost. Gorgeous views which we won't forget. The staff at each interaction were helpful, kind, polite and patient but above anyone Laurent is especially helpful and accommodating! He is a concierge willing to make every effort to please the guests. He's worth seeking out for advice during your stay. Breakfast buffet was simply the best I've ever experienced at any 5 star property in the world. The best! Plentiful variety of fruit,baked good, eggs to order etc. I ordered poached eggs and they were the best I've ever had in my life. We were treated to an extraordinary treat for Swiss",
"Excellent Service, very helpful team","the hotel is extremely comfortable and the location is outstanding during our stay all team members were extremely helpful and competent anyone travelling to Lausanne, looking for a luxury hotel should consider this property we look forward to returning soon",
Grace and Charm,"This is the type of hotel that I associate with my parents and not for me. Wrong. We had a wonderful 4 nights in a lovely room. Not overlooking the front as those prices were huge for us!! But our room was in a lovely quiet part of the Hotel and felt newly and stylishly decorated. Wonderful comfortable bed. We asked for firmer pillows and they arrived immediately. Breakfast was a real joy, relaxed with a wide and very fresh choice. You can eat on the terrace which is lovely but beware the flock of small birds everywhere who crave your bread basket! Service was always attentive particularly by the pool. There were quite a lot of Stagaires/interns for the summer months from local schools like Les Roches - all charming, multilingual and very keen. The concierge also very helpful -",
Good hotel avarage service,"The booking we made was not as expected, They gave us another room with a double bed instead of a separate beds. Just one sink and little place to storage the clothes. The room they said on the phone was the same of the last year, it was not at all. We asked to change the pillow with harder ones and we got softer, We had to ask twice to have somebody helping us with the air conditionning. They told us they would change room the day after but after a while the second person we talked to didn't know anything about it and had to look on the computer again. It is a beautiful hotel, but the service need to be thought again.",
Absolute opulence and impeccable service,"In true traditional Swiss hospitality service ,this is a hotel that really lives up to it's reputation . The rooms are fabulously appointed and so is the service . The food is outstanding and the decor impressive. Ask for a room with lake view.",
Almost flawless luxurious lakefront property.,"Just returned from a three days stay at the Beau Rivage. Very easy to say that it was an extremely relaxing experience. Impressive historical property surrounded by emmaculately kept gardens with stunning views of the Lake of Geneva. Breakfast buffet is typical LHW quality but wonderful if you are lucky enough to sit outside with views of the garden. Restaurants are all excellent. The staff are eager to please, attentive and courteous. One suggestion would be to request an updated ""new"" room with lake view. We stayed in a room that was spacious with an incredible balcony but the old decor was in need of attention. ",
My favorite hotel having a little down?,"The Lausanne Beau-Rivage Palace is my favorite Hotel by far and I've had the chance to stay there regularly for more than 10 years. It is a wonderful classical palace in all ways and next to the beautiful location, the stunning view, the exceptional spa and pool aera, the greatest difference to other top notch resorts was to be found with the staff. Great class and professionalism 24/7. With the recent change of the hotel director a few things seem to be slightly different now. Especially regarding the level of training of the staff. Service at breakfast is mainly young and underexperienced and our sommelier in the 2 star Michelin restaurant ""Anne-Sophie Pic"" was clearly below standards. He was unprepared to receive us as regular guests, didn't knew the wines he recommended and",
Stop off here for an opulent glass of wine in the beautiful garden!,We didn't stay here but returned twice to have some wine and a snack in the luxurious garden. It is well worth the money and spend an hour or so watching the world go by. A beautiful view of the lack also,
Good but not excellent!,"Hotel has many good things - not least location, the rooms and some of the staff. But it lacks in a number of areas - there are lots of staff - but many don't appear to have had proper training. Breakfast service was really poor. If I was coming back to Lausanne - I would probably look to stay somewhere else, which is a shame because it could be superb.",
A beautiful well kept Hotel with exellent service !,"we reserved a Deluxe lake view room and they upgraded us to a Junior Suite, the suite was newly redecorated new carpet, new bathroom with integrated TV in the bathroom Mirror really perfect but it was Room 150 and there was not really a view of the lake because it was a room on the first floor in front of the breakfast pavillion ! Please avoid this room ! We loved the breakfast Buffet on the terrace, the swimming pool and the service !",
GO GO GO to Beau...Rivage in Lausanne,"This is a ""grand dame"" hotel of epic proportions! The service is the BEST part of this hotel - they arranged biking through local vineyards that MADE the visit as well as several other special events we requested! The suite was perfect with an exceptional bottle of champagne and treats as a welcome gift only to be outdone by the spectacular view of the lake and French Alps. Breakfast buffet had something for everyone and the location of the hotel near the ferry to France was extremely convenient. There was so much going on in town as the world soccer matches were being played in France so there was always great nightlife (outdoor concerts both nights we were there were super fun to listen). The indoor-outdoor pool was a great feature as it got quite warm while we were there and",
Wonderful grace,This is a lovely hotel with a wonderful staff and beautiful grounds.The breakfast buffet is grand with many local delicacies and the garden terrace begs you to sit for a lovely glass of wine and enjoy the view. The staff was totally accommodating and provided a wonderful birthday experience for my friend. If you do go here please dine at Anne-Sophie Pic- it was spectacular.,
"Big in aspiration, small in delivery.","Spent two days here with the family recently and booked two connecting deluxe lake view rooms. Admittedly, arrived here on the back of staying in some of the top properties in Switzerland like the Trois Rois in Basel, Bellevue Palace in Bern and The Alpina in Gstaaf, so had great expectations for this one. Check in was at 3pm so arrived at 3:30 but were told that one of our rooms was not ready. Were told that it will be in 30mn but still 2 hours later with two families crammed in one room waiting, nothing was ready and no word from reception neither. Called and asked to speak to the front desk manager and was informed he was busy and will call back. The room was finally made available after 5pm, but no call from the front desk manager and not as much as an apology. Seemed like",
Splendid lakeside hotel with a couple of issues,"We stayed here for one week at the beginning of July. The hotel is very impressive with beautiful grounds and amenities. We booked through LHW and requested a high floor, quiet room with lake view, but were allocated to a first floor room. At first we did not ask to change as the room was refurbished to a high standard and did not think noise would be a problem - we were proved wrong as the week progressed (more of this later). We dined several times in the outdoor restaurant and enjoyed great meals with prompt service. The only issue was that the steak did not arrive cooked to order and had to be returned to the kitchen on two occasions. This meant that my husband had to eat his main course whilst I was still waiting for mine. The breakfast offering was extensive and",
Ok,The reception staff is extremely friendly and nice. Check in/out experience was professional and we felt very welcome. The breakfast food and service was efficient and friendly. Huge buffet spread with lot of local delicacies. The room was clean but the scale was not working. Someone tried to enter my room in the evenings. Might have been housekeeping while I was in the bed. The garden area is well maintained with beautiful flowers. Bit overpriced.,
A relaxing drink on the lobby bar terasse,"A most enjoyable respite from strolling lakeside, take refreshments on the terasse but mind the cheeky sparrows determined to feast on the nibbles provided. There is a plump tabby cat eyeing off the birds bit they are not intimidated. What you would expect from an LHW property. Delightful garden surroundings, efficient but discreet staff, and lovely interiors, there are an an array of options designed to please. Note that, surprisingly, the downstairs bar does not open until 4pm. The gift shoppe provides useful and indulgent items (from chilled champagne, cigars and chocolates to the more eclectic). It remains the best hotel in Lausanne. ",
Needs a little polish,"This classic Hotel is probably one of the best in Lausanne. Beautifully located, and definitely worth a visit. However, there are some things about this Grande Dame that need refinement. Firstly, the bath and shower are combined. Something I dislike immensely – especially when the sides of the bath are high (a Jacuzzi), and one has to climb over to get in, and potentially slip on a wet floor when getting out. This partly due to the high water pressure, and water leakage since the bath/shower is not enclosed. We also found the bathroom overly warm, yet dark for doing makeup. The in-room amenities are by Bulgari. Then there are the Bedside control units, which don’t work as expected, and should be replaced. For the modern traveler who carries lots of gadgets, there is a lack of",
Superb Spa,We became regular tourist to Switzerland after experiencing the Beau Rivage's excellent spa. It is well managed has a superb location and accommodates pure relaxation with refreshments served by the pool and a cafe overlooking the pool that serves very good food and wine. For a British Tourist this year the value and quality of the food was a welcome surprise. The delightful girls in the Spa made us very welcome and even manage to fit a massage in our short 5 day stay. Their remarkable warm hospitality to my wife and myself made this holiday a pleasure.,
Still an excellent hotel,Stayed here a few years ago and though t I would return. Had one of the new rooms on the side but still with a lake view. Complete luxury. Have to say just about everything was perfect. Arrived at just after 3 and was offered a new room with a wait or an old room without a wait. Decided to wait and they took me to the bar and gave me a complementary beer. 15 minutes and ready. Breakfast was excellent. Room was excellent. Gets 5 stars. ,
Spectacular location overlooking Lake Geneva,"This is a beautiful hotel with an ideal location overlooking Lake Geneva. Our room was in the wing looking down on the life sized chess board in the garden, recently renovated with a patio and spacious bathroom with a world class view. I visited a suite on the other side of the hotel which was not to my taste and was glad we got the room we did. There are very good restaurants that are less expensive than the hotel restaurants steps away although the food and atmosphere in the hotel is delicious. They have a pillow menu which allowed us to have the best rest of our trip; I loved the millet pillow. Our only complaint was that we didn't get turn down one night and was offered turn down at 10 pm another night after we were already ready for bed. This seemed strange for such an",
Best hotel in lausanne,I love the rooms looking over the lake Wonderful choice for the breakfast and recommend breakfast in bed Friendly. and professional staff I really enjoyed eating at the Brasserie and the gastronomic restaurant also,
Superb hotel,"First class hotel. Everything is top notch. When we called for an iron, it arrived in 30 seconds - not sure how somebody was physically able to get there that fast! Restaurants are excellent with exceptional food. Location is great - close to boat dock and Olympic museum (less than 10 minute walk). Would absolutely stay again - justifies the high cost.",
Top Hotel,"Great Hotel, My wife's favorite from our stay in Switzerland. Best Breakfast from all the hotels also. We had Superior Room with full lake view, Palace wing. It's right next to the boat port and we took the boat to the Chateau. Easy from the train station,three stops on the metro. Get off at last stop, Ouchy.",
Best hotel in Lausanne,I stayed last year on 3rd of March with my fiancée and it was one of the best moment in my life. Hotel was decent and they explained all the facilities when we checked in and room was fascinating. I would recommend to everyone who going to Lausanne and my people. ,
Excellent hotel,Great stay on the waterfront of the Lac Léman! Excellent hotel! We enjoyed our 4 days very much. Perfect service and beautiful spa. Very good restaurants and a beautiful garden! I can only recommend the hotel!,
Holiday trip&birthday,"Beautiful hotel, Super great staff,We had uncreable 1 nigth holiday. Best hotel ever!!! Duplex suite was excellent. Beautiful view over the lake. Nice interesting olympic museum on the neighbour. Good breakfast... Yam yam Br. from Finland !!",
Legendary Experience,"One of the truly great hotels of the world I am happy to confirm continues in great hands and with exceptional upkeep. Renowned for its views, the constantly changing panorama drives one to write books, rethink life or indeed continue just being yourself. A cure in itself!",
Weekend Break,Top Notch service from arrival to departure. Ask for the renovated rooms. Spa treatments and pool area are excellent. Multilingual staff are extremely helpful. Sunday brunches are amazing but you need to book well in advance. Great views from upper floors but you need to request lake view. Rooms have everything you need.,
Best service ever.,"Aussie family on holiday. I came here for the first time with my parents, we stayed for 5 nights. My parents have been here multiple times before and keep returning for blatantly obvious reasons. It correctly claims to be one of the leading hotels of the world. Established in 1861, it has hosted many famous and prestigious guests including Gregory peck, Pele, Nelson Mandela, Cristiano Ronaldo etc. You can see who they are in the hallway leading up to Miyako, the restaurant on lower ground floor. The hotel itself is, although an old building, beautifully decorated inside. Grand mirrors and chandeliers, beautiful artworks, vases and flowers changed every few days to reflect whatever is in season. The rooms are classically decorated, spacious, with balconies overlooking the lake",
Return visit,Aussies visiting Europe. This hotel is undoubtably my favourite hotel. This is our fourth visit and we have never experienced bad service. Every staff member you meet during your stay is polite and welcoming. Breakfast is served in a beautiful room and is superb. The food served in the Japanese restaurant is of a high quality. The spa area is excellent and both the indoor and outdoor pools are worth a visit. The change room facilities have everything you need. The rooms overlooking the lake are very special. We will return next time we visit Lausanne. ,
Great hotel!,"Stayed in early March because of the car show in Geneva. Very nice hotel, very convenient location and wonderful view to the lake. Service is ok, people quite friendly. Would easily recommend and would not hesitate to return.",
Mixed bag,"The brasserie , Cafe Beau-Rivage , was excellent except for the service from the head waiter. The food and the other staff were excellent. The Michelin star rated restaurant Anne-Sophie Pic was pretentious, overpriced and absolutely nothing we had on 2 different menus was anywhere near delicious. Such a huge disappointment. Breakfast buffet was ok. Service was good. Mixed bag. Room was nice but small and we were upgraded ! ",
Still one of the top hotels in Europe,The Beau Rivage is one of the very best hotels I stayed in. Rooms are excellent and terrace/gardens are simply fantastic. Stunning lake- & mountain view. Hotel service is unbeatable. Restaurants are top quality, breakfast is great.
Beautiful Hotel With Great Service !,Great Epoque French structure. Very detailed work and amazing views od the Alps in Switzerland. Super restaurants and Chefs. The indoor and spa area are great outlets during a marvelous luxury hotel stay.,
Perfect stay every single time,"This is one of my favourite hotels in Swiss and my first preference in Lausanne. The hotel can claim their bragging rights for perfect service every single time. Situated by the lac Leman, the hotel has picturesque views of the mountains and the lake. A stone throw away from the Olympic museum which is the most popular tourist spot in Lausanne. The hotel is very well equipped for a business traveller and if the need arises, the relationship manager has always found a way out for me. The indoor swimming pool is not to be missed with its stunning views. The hotel houses the restaurant Anne Sophie where dining is a memorable experience. The pic collection menu is something I can vouch for. I'd strongly recommend the hotel to anyone who plans to visit Lausanne for breathtaking",
One of the most beautiful hotels in the world,This is absolutely one of the most beautiful hotels in the world. My room is right in front of Lake Geneva and Evian Mountain. Magnificent view! The room is recently renovated and elegant. Staff at the front desk is so friendly! Would like to go back and recommend to anyone.,
The spa is a little bit of heaven!,"Wonderful week long stay at the Beau Rivage Hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland. Everything about the hotel was beautiful and well appointed but the highlight for me was the amazing spa with terrific indoor and outdoor pools. Every day I enjoyed a morning swim followed by a steam and shower. Fabulous!",
It Truly Feels Like a Palace,"Great in every way: the rooms, the property, the food, the staff. I didn't have a chance to use the spa, unfortunately. I stayed for four nights in May, and the only regret is I could not stay longer and take more advantage of the facilities. The views if the lake are beautiful, the staff very helpful. For example, we went out hiking and, upon our return, we were greeted at the door with slippers for our feet and bags for our (muddy) boots.",
Exceptional hotel,"I can't say a bad word about this hotel. The staff were warm, welcoming and efficient across the board. The public areas of the hotel are stunning. We had a junior suite with a lake view and it was beautifully appointed and well maintained with a beautiful view. I was only sorry we couldn't stay longer and I will definitely return if I get the chance. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. ",
happy 77077,Our hotel stay at the Beau-Rivage Palace was a beautiful experience. The hotel service was impeccable every staff member anticipated your needs and went to great lengths to ensure you had a wonderful stay at the hotel.,
Amazing Experience,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in while in Europe. We enjoyed our stay. Located right on the lake. In the US, hotel food is usually mediocre. Not so here! We hotel breakfast, restaurant and bar were the best food in Lausanne. Don't hesitate to book a stay with them. Truly fantastic!",
wonderful experience,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference. It was a beautiful hotel. All rooms well appointed we had two balconies (one off the bedroom and one off the bathroom) the service was efficient (although a little language disconnect at times) The good was good and the bar/lounge had great ambiance. The outside seating off the bar was so relaxing. The property well maintained and comfortable. Not s stuff hotel at all! If it were not so far away, I would definitely return.",
Incredible experience,"We were fortunate enough to stay for two nights at Beau-Rivage Palace last weekend, with my partner and 5 year old girl. We have stayed in some really nice places throughout Europe but without doubt Beau-Rivage is the best. The level of service and attention to detail was faultless, from the time we checked in until we left. We had a Junior Suite which was enormous with a jacuzzi bath and a balcony with amazing views over the lakes and Alps. The staff went the extra mile for our daughter with little robes and slippers left for her and a little mocktail voucher that she could collect. We dined in Anne-Sophie Pic and again the staff went the extra mile with our daughter, giving her a tour of the kitchens etc. The food was excellent, the staff were excellent, it's everything a",
Amazing Sunday brunch,This is a brunch of the highest quality - and for just under 100 swiss francs you enjoy not only a great setting in all seasons but eat in one of Europe's top hotels.It includes a glass of champagne and the choice is overwhelming and caters for all tastes Strongly recommended,
Even better than I remembered!,"I just returned from four nights at Beau Rivage and there was not ONE thing complain about! From the Welcome back Madame at the start of our stay, to the kind farewell this hotel as got it right!! I brought my daughter here for a relaxing Mother Daughter Spa getaway. The Spa is Lovely and the staff well prepared to deal with international guests. On arrival we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a Junior Suite. Absolutely perfect! Amazing decor, lovely scented candle, beautiful bathroom with Bulgari toiletries. The also provided a bed and bowls for our little dog who joined us on the trip. Can not wait to go back!!",
A Hotel Par Excellence,"The property is breathtakingly beautiful: the rooms, the grounds, the common areas and the views. The corridors are bright and beautiful. The rooms are elegantly decorated in muted colors and thoughtfully designed to accommodate your every need. The bathroom was small, but elegant. The service was outstanding. The staff went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that my every need was met. Before I arrived, I had a nasty fall. After I checked in, I started to experience a great deal of pain. I called the front desk and requested a pain killer. They sent me some very effective medication, a hot water bottle and a heating pad - all at no charge. I highly recommend this property.",
Still the 'grand old lady?,"Well yes you can say that the hotel renovation has been succesfull. Not only the hotel self but trully also the other hotels around ( all part of the BR hotel now) The 'new owners' from the Middle East' has been active in Lausanne the past 2 years. And its shows. Ooh yes, the BR Hotel. Great, super (too) expensive and to much nouveau riche. But that will go away in time and than the grand old lady will still be there. On the border of the Lake... Already for a long, long time!",
A perfect stay!,We stayed at the Beau Rivage in Lausanne for three nights and I have never experienced a more polite and professional staff anywhere else in the world. Our room had a lake view and it was very quiet. The SPA section was fantastic! Not a cheap experience.. but woth every penny of it !,
Wow!,"I stayed at the Beau Rivage while attending a conference in Lausanne. I could tell it would be a good visit when, at check-in, the desk clerk informed me that I had been upgraded to a junior suite with lake view. The room was stunning, and very large by European standards. There was a bottle of wine and snacks waiting for me, along with a huge chocolate Easter egg (I arrived on Easter). The service was impeccable all week. The breakfast each morning was very good, and I had a terrific meal one evening in the Café, which is quite upscale. I definitely will return again for a vacation when I can truly enjoy the hotel facilities.",
Beautiful setting,"What a gorgeous hotel. Excellent service and location. Rooms are a little old-fashioned and tired now, but there is a real feeling of stepping back in time. Tranquil lake setting is stunning. Food and beverage is outrageously priced, but hey this is 5-star Switzerland, so what do you expect..?",
Simply the best !!,"A superb hotel located on the side of Lake Geneva with a wonderful vista of the lake and Alps. I have stayed in numerous 5* hotels, and Beau Rivage Palace tops the lot. Just a great hotel, that fully earns its 5* rating.",
a wonderfull stay,"If you are fed up witn so-colled luxourious hotels where you pay a maximum and not receive quality and service, then have a stay at ""Beau Rivage"" where you'll enjoy a fantastic experience . the location is superb, just along the Leman, the service is exceptionnal, the food is very nice, specially the breakfast, the view from your room on the Leman (I strongly suggest to choose one) is charming. The are several restaurants, all ate very good, the I consider the Academia one of the best Italian table I know.",
A rare gem,"Awesome is an understatement. Staying at this hotel is like stepping back in time with very modern amenities. Top of the line bath kit- Bulgari. Nice view of the Alps and Lake Geneva. I could live here forever. Fine dining at its best at Cafe Beau Rivage. The hotel is very quiet, classy and if you value your privacy at most, this is the place to be. ",
"Wonderful, Sublime","I travel quite a bit and from time to time a hotel stands out and this is one of those times. The Beau Rivage Palace is a beautiful hotel situated on Lake Geneva with the snow capped Alps glistening in the distant background. The service here is excellent, the food very good, the rooms comfortable and the sense of calm relaxing and comforting. Now this is what a 5 star hotel should be and rarely is. The hotel is owned by a foundation and while most hotels chase profits this one seems to focus on the service and the money end of things seems to be a secondary issue to the benefit of its clients. Sure the prices are hight but so then is the service. A room with a lake view will always be appreciated and if you swing for that you will be pleased. The only downside to my room",
Another perfect stay,"Stayed for two nights in a refurbished room in the Palace wing with a view onto the lake. The room was perfect - quiet, very high quality fittings, very easy to use light switches and electric blinds. Every little detail has been executed very well. Check-in and service were first-class as ever. The pool and spa great to use and accessible from the rooms via a dedicated lift. Food in the Café Beau-Rivage excellent. Perhaps not the cheapest but the Beau-Rivage Palace always delivers.",
Hospitality as its best!,"First of all: It's rare that I write such a positive comment, however, in this case, it's absolutely deserved: Beau Rivage Palace Hotel is providing an incredibly excellent service level at a fantastic location. They really make you feel hospitality in its essence - the whole staff team really knows and lives the art of hospitality. To me, Beau Rivage is simply one of the best hotels I've ever seen in the world. Given that I spent in total several weeks at Beau Rivage returning to this beautiful place during a longer time period again and again, I think my rating is based on a represenative sample of repeatingly very positive experiences. Being quite a lot on travel having seen numerous different hotels in the meantime, I can highly recommend the Beau Rivage Palace Hotel for",
Dream stay at le Beau Rivae,"One of the most amazing hotel experience, we loved every moment of our stay! From the warm welcome of the staff, to the delicately scented lobby to an astonishing room with view of the lake. This is a magical place, which leaves you happy, restored and calm.",
Exceptional. Nothing is too much trouble.,"This is a fantastic hotel. The service is impressively pitched: efficient and diligent but not cloying. The staff anticipate your needs without being pushy. The property is beautiful. Lovely spacious rooms with charming decoration and plenty of light. The spa is similarly well appointed. The one potential downside is that this is a big place. In fact I do not mind this, and the service is so good one does not feel faceless, but it would not be suitable for those who want the 'boutique' experience. ",
lunch on the terrace,we had today lunch on the terrace. the service and food were ok but not completly up to the standards. we stayed 1 1/2 hours and paid sfr 110. surprisingly enough when we got the car back we were told to pay for the parking fee. we went back to reception and they said it is the hotels policy. for this reason i would never go back for a lunch or dinner and can not reccommend the place,
Pure opulence,"This hotel is marvelous. It's like stepping back in time with very modern amenities. Top of the line bath kit- Bulgari. Nice view of the Alps and Lake Geneva. I could live here forever. Fine dining at its best at Cafe Beau Rivage. The hotel is very quiet and if you value your privacy at most, this is the place to be.",
Excellent,"Stayed at the BRP for 3 nights on business. Beautiful property in great location and stunning views. The room appeared to have recently been refurbished to high standards. Beds are very comfortable, great linen and bathroom products- nothing to complain about. Service very professional, discrete but attentive. Beautiful grounds as well. Breakfast is lovely, beautiful setting, high quality product. Enjoyed as well the bar and other restaurants- can only recommend this property when in Lausanne.",
Amazing view,"This was my third time in Beau Rivage and I could say it was the best one. The hotel has renovated many rooms and the quality is outstanding. I would really recommend to have a room with lake view (spacious rooms, with great bathroom and changing areas), which differentiate the location of the hotel. Spa is great with a great sauna and indoor swimming pool, I suggest to book in advance, because the spa is always full. Good restaurants for lunch and dinner, the small japanese restaurant was a surprise for me!",
One of the best,"The hotel is fantastic and woderful .. outstanding services for guests , friendly staff and hotel location is close to the centre. The room was clean and arranged ..one of beautiful and prestigious hotels I have ever visited ... I would visit it again in the future ....",
"Landmark hotel, partially refurbished","Pros: - one of Geneva lake iconic hotel in landmark building - location is directly facing the lake, in Ouchy a quiet residential area, but be warned as is it off centered, about 10mn walk and tram to central lausanne. - very pleasant spa facilities including in and outdoor pool, hammam, sauna. - service was overall friendly and mostly efficient Cons: - the hotel has been partially renovated so while the newer parts are very pleasant (bar, breakfast room, pool, some rooms), the old part is by no means up to the standards of the legend. Make sure you enquire about your room preferences as it can make a huge difference (for the well travelled, renovated rooms look a lot like the Four Seasons Grand Hotel du Cap Ferrat as they have been refurbished by the same designer). -",
Great experience on a long weekend,"Palace setting and great open spaces. The bar outside is simply wonderful, the view on the lake is breath taking. The staff is experienced and professional as always. I come on long weekends a couple times a year where i treat myself to the restaurants and the spa treatments.",
What a hotel....,"I was purely amazed. From the first moment, you enter the hotel the staff made you feel very welcome. Especially Caroline (hope I am not wrong) made a fantastic check in and rooming. I like it when staff is acting naturally and not as if they acting to get an Oscar. So first impression was great. Then we saw the room and we were speechless... by the way thank you for the unbelievable upgrade to the lake view rooms. The rooms are modern but not to modern to destroy the beautiful elegance of the hotel. We went out for dinner so I can't tell something about the restaurants... but I am sure they are great as well. The concierge Jonathan is also one of these persons, about every hotel could be proud of to call them their employee. You can feel in the first second that he is living",
Complete Luxury,"Beautiful hotel with stunning lake views. Stay in a room with a view. Room was first class and spotless. Staff were attentive and very helpful. Male and female steam and sauna, which was unusual. Breakfast was excellent, with a buffet style and table service. If you get a chance take a drive along the lakeside road to Montreux. Stunning views on a fine day. Go early as the road and crowds gather in the afternoon on a weekend. Sure it's pricey but if sheer luxury is what you want, go for it!",
Excellent hotel. Engaging staff.,"As others have noted, this hotel, like most in Switzerland, is not inexpensive. However, it's location, service and accommodations make it a wonderful place to stay. Located on Lac Limon (called Lake Geneva by those living in Geneva, but not those in Lausanne), the setting is picturesque. We strolled along the lake passed the Olympic museum and enjoyed the setting. We also were conveniently located near the tram station and were able to use it to get to the old town. We had a very nice room with a great view of the lake. The room was comfortable and spacious. Service was excellent from the outset. I especially want to commend the staff in the restaurant at breakfast. They were engaging and very helpful and even suggested places to go - we took one suggestion on a place for",
"If you dont min the price, there is nothing else to consider, wonderful by all means","This is not a cheap hotel. However, if you dont mind the price, everything else is perfect. The decoration, rooms, staff, location, views, cleanliness, view and the atmosphere were perfectly perfect. If you want to stay in a real palace like place with a 5 star service, this is the pla e for you. Again, the only thing to consider is the price and if you are ok with that no need to think twice for anything else.",
Wonderful,"Exlellent experience. Was warm in July and AC is not as cold as we are used to in US. Over, the hotel and grounds were impeccable and amazing. The staff were sincerely helpful and fun. Would highly recommend.",
Unforgetable!!,"We spent an unforgettable 3 nights at the Beau-Rivage Palace Lausanne; the beautiful hotel on Lake Geneva. From the moment we entered the hotel we knew we were somewhere very special. Nothing was ever a problem. The staff were exceptional. The food was superb. The spa was incredible. Highlights of our trip: dining at the Anne Sopie Pic Restaurant, and breakfast on the terrace; a view and food to remember forever",
Hotels don't come any better,"If your travels take you to Lausanne, aim for the Beau Rivage Palace. Swiss luxury hotels don't come any better. Yes, it is expensive but you get something for your money. Old world charm and style with the best of modern hotels including noiseless quality air conditioning. The food is superbe and the service equal to non.",
The lap of luxury on Lake Leman,"The hotel is an old classic with all the modern amenities. It is perfectly situated, overlooking Lake Leman. The walks along the lake are splendid in any weather. The hotel service is exquisite, and the outdoor space is unbeatable. I enjoyed the Cinq Mondes spa (for a massage) and the indoor/outdoor pools. The room was well sized, perfectly kept up, and quiet. The hotel decor spells classic beauty, and even though hotel facilities are large enough for corporate events and larger groups, it did not feel like a business hotel. The Anne-Sophie Pic restaurant serves creative dishes, and is definitely a destination for a special occasion. L'Accademia serves an Italian fare, and the outdoor setting is lovely. For 3 days I did not even want to leave the hotel, able to enjoy the",
"Spectacular hotel, amazing service, beautiful lake... Hotel Beau Rivage Palace","If you are looking for luxury, this is the place for you. This hotel captures the glory of the old days and updates it with today's technology. The restaurants are beautiful with incredible food (french, continental, Italian and Japanese), the staff are very accommodating, and the location is lovely. Steps from the hotel is the lake with a walkway where everyone is strolling and taking pictures of the mountains in the distance.",
Excellent stay,"We stayed with the SPA experience package with breakfast, champagne, flowers, 2 treatments at the ""5 mondes"" SPA. We were upgraded to a Junior suite with lake view which was the cherry on the cake. We knew the Palace through its bar and restaurants but we never took the opportunity to stay a night over and try the SPA. During our stay all the staff was highly efficient and nice: Carolina at front desk as well as Lila, Aude and Sophie at the SPA. If you stay there, we highly recommend the SPA with its treatments for 2 and excellent staff. Will definitely go back.",
Speechless,"Once again, we were on a trip with my employers--we never in a a million years would have dared set foot in this hotel otherwise! It was AMAZING! We didn't have a lake view in our room, but we stepped across the hall for school time and saw my employers' three-room suite with lake view...stunning! Our own room was comfortable, cozy, and a wonderful treat for us newlyweds! We enjoyed breakfast in our room and also enjoyed basking in the sun-drenched gardens for lunch. Definitely an experience of a lifetime!",
Love the Beau-Rivage Palace Lausanne!!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Beau-Rivage Palace in Lausanne for a long weekend in January. It is definitely a Swiss 5 ++ Star hotel for both it's quality and level of service. The room accommodations, the SPA/pool area, the breakfast restaurant and l'Accademia restaurant were all thoroughly enjoyed. As the hotel is on the waterfront in Ouchy, it is a short metro ride from the SBB Lausanne station to the hotel. I am sure that the hotel is normally frequented by both business & conference guests. If you have the chance to spend a leisure visit here to enjoy the hotel and its facilities, I recommend that you do so. We have already planned a return visit this year!",
Best hotel in Lausanne,"This hotel is by no means cheap, but you get exactly what you pay for. Firstly the hotel itself is stunning, has 3 different restaurants and its own park. The hotel provides an epic view for breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as for the guests of the bar. The hotel is situated in a comfortable location, walking distance from most shops and bars of Lausanne if you ever feel the need to leave the hotel. The service is impeccable (they can get you ANYTHING you like as long as you are respectful). Only place to stay in Lausanne in my opinion.",
Expected more from a 5 star hotel,The room was quite small in comparison to others that I have been to. The biggest issue was the rudeness of much of the dining staff. I was there for a private event and it seem they were more worried about being efficient then in providing pleasant customer service.,
Superb!,"Beautiful hotel with unobtrusive but perfect service, I cannot find a single negative about this hotel. The setting is stunning and we were fortunate enough to have a suite in the Palace part overlooking the lake, the rooms were totally luxurious. The spa is excellent, the outdoor and indoor pools were both appreciated as the weather was mixed. Location makes it incredibly easy to dine at many restaurants by the lake, although the restaurants were wonderful at the hotel it was good to have the option of local and cheaper alternatives. It's easy to access the rail network from the nearby metro, we took a train and walked through the vineyards which I highly recommend ( the tourist centre a few hundred metres from the hotel gave us details and routes). Breakfast sat on the",
Outstanting hotel,Everything is perfect in this hotel. Certainly one of the grand hotels in Europe. Service everywhere is faultless. We had dinner in the Anne-Sophie Pic restaurant - an absolutely first rate restaurant. If staying at the Beau Rivage make a reservation at this restaurant.,
Fantastic experience,"This hotel provides outstanding service in a phenomenal setting. Not stuffy, but classy. The spa is beautiful, the restaurants excellent (two-starred Michelin in house). The staff is particularly kind, and you are made to feel at home. In addition, this is a family-friendly place with great amenities for kids. If you are looking for an exceptional experience, this is a place to consider. It's expensive, but worth every penny.",
close to perfection,"This hotel has magical presence...a stay in this establishment offers an escape from everyday life and a universe of quiet, efficient luxury, where service comes with a smile, and the chaos of modern life fades into the background. It really offers the best of Switzerland, in a dreamlike setting, out of time and yet firmly rooted in today's world.",
Luxurious and historic,"This hotel is an amazing experience. Delightful decor, sumptuous furnishings throughout the hotel. Comfortable, plush rooms with heated rail and other luxuries like Bulgari toiletries Staff were courteous, polite and helpful",
Swiss made....perfection,"The hotel is by far one of the jewels of the Geneva Lake region. The hotel is outstanding, the service amazing and the cafe restaurant has one of the best steak tartare that I had tasted. The overall rating of the hotel is well deserved! This an outstanding hotel!",
B-Day night,"Perfect present to your darling for celebrating an event... Large bedroom, great view over Lac Léman. The breakfast is definitely one of the best one. Free public transportation very useful to reach city centre. To recommend , even if slightly expensive.",
Swiss perfectionism applied to hospitality,"Everything from check-in to check-out was perfect. We were in a new room facing the Lake: an absolute dream. Food was outstanding. A rare thing: The hotel's restaurants were always full of locals coming for lunch or dinner, demonstrating the quality of the service and food/drinks. My girlfriend was also very impressed by the spa... A dream. Her question when leving was: ""When do we come back?""",
Charming Experience,Beau-Rivage Palace is self effacing. You wouldn't think much of it until you make your first step into the building. It has charming decor with extremely pleasant staff. They have fine dining which is above Michelin standards. Very beautiful and yet traditional. It made a mark on us. Will definitely stay there when in Lausanne.,
Great Experience,Second stay in a year and even better than the previous one not least of all due to more spacious and quieter room this time round. The cuisine and wine choice was top class and staff very attentive in a good way. The swimming pool was never too busy. This is a good choice for tasteful luxury.,
Breathtaking beauty..,Beau-Rivage Palace was on my must-visit place for some time. I have visited with some friends on November 2015. We all loved the simplicity of the hotel. Very chic and not too fancy. Great staff. The location is perfect location. I would definitely recommend to get room with a lake view. Although we face with a bad room (had strange smell) they responded very friendly and had us relocated to another room.,
"Another ecellent stay at the Beau Rivage Palace, Lausanne","Every stay at this hotel is memorable. Excellent in every important subject for a visitor: Location' level of service, accommodation, restaurants, hospitality, spa. We love returning there again and again. Total relaxation.",
Beautiful hotel,My husband and I went to spend a weekend in this wonderful hotel. The setting is perfect and the service is awesome!. The weather was fantastic and we could even swim in the outdoor swimming pool. I recommend this hotel if you want to be pampered and spend some time in a beautiful place.,
Great New bedroom,"I stayed there during a corporate event. The hotel has two wings: one with renovated rooms and one with vintage old rooms. My room was a new one and was perfect with a small imperfection, the switchers for the lighting were not easy to understand. The shower was the ""best shower"" I found in a hotel with perfect water pressure, easy-to-handle commands, perfect size and lighting. Service was also overall great. As a perfectionist I could encourage to add some ""good tasting innovation"" into the menu of the bar at the -1 floor. I would for sure stay there again and recommend the new rooms of the hotel. ",
Top Luxury Leading Hotel,"I was there for a hotel conference and found this hotel something that I could learn from. Top service, great attitude, food and generally an amazing all round 5 star luxury hotel. definitely recommend this hotel.",
Restaurant Anne-Sophie Pic,"This is the top restaurant out of 4 available in this prestigious hotel/palace. Old world charm and elegance for the hotel but modern decor and sophistication for this restaurant. I was entertaining clients, and three of us went a la carte and the other the set lunchtime menu. Slick service and delicious food was expected and delivered. Prices are as would be expected in a 3star establishment, but $30 a glass for Kir Royale was a bit OTT !!",
Congratulations,"Many congratulations for the exquisite, great and lovely service provided. Great hotel. Great property. Great food & beverage offer. Staff very eficiente. fine location. a true gem. Lausanne is a very interesting city for a short break or relax.",
Great location and old-world charme,Great location and very good facilities. Attentive and helpful staff always friendly and willing to help. I loved the gardens and the outside pool. Nevertheless The heating on the terraces for cigar smokers is not convenient and should be revised and ameliorated.,
Incredible experience,"Stayed at Beau-Rivage as part of a major conference and that can sometimes take away the feeling of being looked after as an individual. You are generalised and forgotten. Not at Beau-Rivage. The team at the hotel offer and incredible experience from start to finish. Nothing is too big or to small to ask for. I needed an iron and iron board on arrival and also put the odd request to keep it during my stay. Not a question or even a comment that they don't have enough or that I could only use their own pressing service. Considering it was a conference and I am sure everyone asked for the same thing, my iron and board stayed in the room all throughout and for me that is luxury. Small detail but all so important for what I like. The breakfast. Wow. I am not a morning person and",
The best experience!,"This hotel is a dream. It's huge! Personal is so friendly and helpful! It's was just perfect! We had amazing room in new renovated part of the hotel. Truly old and stunning hotel! It's like old castle! You can feel the history there. I have no words to explain how great it's was. I hope to be back there again and again. On top it's pets friendly. We were with our little dog. Breakfast rich and tasty. Bed very soft! And we had amazing huge bath! It's was the biggest bath from all hotels I've visited in last years (not jacuzzi, which is different). And of course, it's not cheap hotel at all. But it's worth it.",
"One of the friendliest service hotel I'd ever been,","Arriving Lausanne from Dijon by car, due to some complications at French-Swiss border, we were 3 hours from our original schedule. Along the way, I was able to communicate with the hotel reservation team via email. I notified them of my problem and they quickly understood and arranged all our needs. Upon arriving, check in process was a breeze. Our luggages arrived our room quickly. Unfortunately, Sophie Ann Pic was full so as other restaurants in the hotel. Quick recommendation by the lovely concierge, we got a table at L'Accademia at the sister property 5 minutes away. I forgot to mention that we booked our room with full lake view. Morning time, the view was spectacular. I highly recommend this full lake view room, especially if you plan to spend most of your time on a slow",
Great Location and Ambience,"A bsolutely beautiful hotel - grand from the outside and grand on the inside. On arrival I told the recepcionist that I wish that I had brought my wife with me - it was that ""grand"" and more an event than a night at a hotel. The service was excellent, breakfast was classy - service discreet, but attentive. The room was elegant and I had the feeling of being somewhere special - lots of little touches, quality bath products, everything laid out in an obvious and user friendly way. I am keen to return. My one push back was the price of breakfast that seemed excessive, even by Swiss standards",
"2ND STAY IN THIS AWESOME PALACE, GREAT PLACE TO ENJOY LIFE !!!","My wife and I stayed in Beau-Rivage Palace for the 2nd time, from 07-08th of November 2015. We had the Superior Lake View room number 353, on 3rd floor, with balcony. The service provided by the staff was as usual excellent and of high standing, the Palace was very clean and we saw several employee in charge of cleaning making their job with care and attention, as it should be done within such kind of luxury Hotel. We were able to use the fitness and the swimming pool, even outside and by night due to exceptionally good weather conditions for November ! Food service was also very good, fast and efficient. So, to resume our stay, I will say that : Positive Points : --------------------- 1) Free wifi in room. 2) 2 complimentary bottles of water in room. 3) Bulgary products in",
perfect combination of old world charm and Swiss precision,"The Beau-Rivage gets high marks across the board and is a true five star property in every sense. The location on the banks of Lake Geneva with the alps as backdrop is spectacular, and the property is impeccably maintained. Their are several nice bars - particularly the new one on the ground floor, and a variety of high to higher end dining options on the grounds. I believe all rooms have lake views, and there are nice touches throughout including fresh orchids in the room. Relative to many top European hotels, the gym is nicely appointed (if small) and the spa is awesome - beautiful sauna! Two small caveats - the hotel is large and definitely caters to group events; it does not have a boutique feel though you could definitely travel here with your spouse. The gym only",
Beautiful Historic Hotel Propertry,"This hotel on my short list for a return visit. It combines five star service with a unique location and great natural beauty. The old historic hotel is majestic combining art deco with neo-baroque buildings. Service was flawless, the staff were first class and we felt welcome. I made one visit to the spa which just made me wish I had spent more time there. I look forward to a return visit. I would like to thank Mr Marcel Bernard Reception Manager for the extraordinary service he provided and also Mrs. Sylvie Gonin Head Concierge for being a beautiful exuberant interested person.",
Wow!,"Lovely property - very glad to be there although glad the company was picking up the tab. The location is beautiful, the rooms are well appointed with consideration given to every possible need and convenient to anywhere you could want to go in the area given it's proximity to the metro and train station.",
Fun,"Tardy review. I have great memories of this hotel. Quiet, private and very pretty. The grounds are very nice and it is a great place to stay in order to walk along the lake or visit some of the nearby areas. Also a good place to spend a few days relaxing. ",
Old World Hotel in a Beautiful Setting,"Very nice hotel, although a little stuffy. Perfect location on Lake Geneva and only a few block walk to the metro to get into old Lausanne. Restaurants and lounge are very expensive. Imagine is even better in the summer months.",
Lovely Hotel w amazing views but unhelpful Desk staff,The venue is gorgeously placed on the lake with delightful patios . The rooms are well outfitted and the staff in the bar and dining rooms gracious. However the staff at the front desk was pretentious and unhelpful when asked to help solve a practical issue around luggage transfer- something I have seen the Ritz or Klimpton hotels resolve graciously a dozen times before. If I wanted help I would need to speak to the Concierge.... Who was nowhere to be found. / spend close to 75 nights a year in a hotel. To me the mark of a great hotel is staff who want to earn your respect and affection-- and thus repeat business. I didn't experience that here. ,
Beau Rivage review,"Wonderful hotel, deserves its 5 stars. On shore of beautiful lake with views out to snowy mountains. Convenient to Lausanne Center by cable car which leaves from near the hotel. Rooms are elegant and extremely luxurious. Staff are incredibly professional. I only ate food prepared for a conference and it was excellent. I did not pay for my room and do not know how much it cost, but I noticed that food etc. was expensive - perhaps justified by its quality.",
Thank you BEAU-RIVAGE PlALACE,Just I want to say special thanks for lovely staff on our reception Carol &Carolina& Joanna & wonderful Andrea. Was more than amazing service and all kinds from hotel food and our room also the location of the hotel overall it is amazing thanks for welcome me ,
Elegant And Personal,A beautiful property is only as good as it is run. We knew from our greeting at reception by the amazing Tianyu that we were going to enjoy our visit here.Her friendliness and diligence to make sure we were happy with our room and stay brought faith that there is hope for today's youth ! She found us a beautiful Junior Suite on the top floor that had a beautiful lake view and even an in-room sauna which I have never seen before in a hotel room .All staff members we came in contact with were helpful and friendly too..from concierge to servers in the restaurants..Speaking of the restaurants..The Grill was outstanding..The Japanese needs help...and the breakfast was very nice. Would stay here again if in Lausanne,
Wonderful hotel and staff,"Such a treat to be able to stay at Beau Rivage, fabulous hotel with amazing guest rooms over looking lac Lemain with charming and helpful staff and excellent facilities Enjoyed dinner at cafe Beau Rivage, staff very helpful suggested a great local beer ""Voisin"" which I enjoyed. I had brunch in La Terrace on Sunday with two friends which was very good, an interesting selection of classic brunch items and other lighter options we enjoyed the roast veal and gratin Look forward to returning to Beau Rivage",
Fantastic stay at a fantastic hotel,"Visited Lausanne on our Swiss Tour recently and stayed at this amazing property. Already on arrival we felt welcomed from the personal greeting us outside of the hotel when unpacking our car. Warm welcome by Guy and his colleagues at the front desk as well as the Guest Relation staff. They followed us to our rooms (2 adults, 2 children and our dog) and gave us quick introduction to the hotel facilities etc. Rooms are recently refurbished and cosy (lake views are amazing). Our dog got her own bed/pillow to sleep on as well as welcome kit (water bowl). When we visited the Olympic museum the friendly staff of the front desk took care of our dog. Breakfast at the hotel is great, perfect assortment of fruits, cereals, bread, hot and cold dishes and great service as well. The SPA/Gym",
"Awesome Location, Comfort & Luxury.","I stayed a week in this lovely hotel in a study trip. I must say that it was an extraordinary experience. The whole hotel is focused into high quality infrastructure and service. I was staying in a standard room with an incredible sight to the lake, a nice upgrade surprise, which was quiet, bright luminous and with every modern technology available as electric louvers and curtains, wi-fi, lots of amenities, a shower with great pressure and very hot water (maybe extra shower space would make it perfect) and room temperature to taste. Great room ! People is extremely kind and service minded, always willing to help even if you're just wondering around. The Front Desk is very efficient and the Concierge team has great knowledge and contacts to sort things out with, for example, busy",
Luxury at a crossroad,"The Beau-Rivage Palace is definitely among the most luxurious Places to stay in Switzerland and it offers the whole spectrum of Service and Amenities one would expect of a hotel at this level. I would like to point out the highly renowned 2 Star Michelin Restaurant ""Anne-Sophie Pic"" which really is worth every one of the two. The management (or the owner?) however will have to decide, which direction it wants to take regarding client structure. The product I buy and the Service they offer - ""Hospitality, Serving the guests"" is of course also depending on the mix of guests and events taking place. Now Lausanne, just as Geneva, is a very international city, and the staff is doing a great job handling the various cultural, religious and personal demands. But, f.ex. which level of",
Splendid and unique,"The best hotel I have stayed in in Switzerland. Great location, perfect service and fantastic views make this hotel a must destination if you travel to Lausanne. Access if from the back and not the Lake Front. Ample parking and very friendly and welcoming staff.",
Beautiful hotel,Upgraded to this hotel - excellent facility. Hotel and grounds were beautiful and our breakfast was marvellous. We were very appreciative of the upgrade and would recommended this hotel to anyone. Especially recommend the very friendly and helpful staff.,
C'est magnifique!,"Iconic property, extremely friendly staff, luxurious rooms and classic f&b outlets makes your stay flawless here. It's in a great location. I stayed in the newly renovated block, all white in decor. Even the alleyway leading to the rooms are white and gives an elegant look to the property. Rooms are spacious and luxurious, classic in style, bathroom amenities from Bvlgari (this is the only property where I saw Bvlgari bathroom amenities in my career, I don't think we have this here in Dubai). Service is impeccable as beautiful as the picturesque view from the balcony! There were weddings happening on one of those days I stayed there and it was gorgeous! I didn't use the pool and the spa since I didn't have time. This is the finest hotel in Lausanne and I am sure it will take",
What Else Can Be Said? Fantastic!,"Let me say that this hotel is not for the budget conscious, so you must get yourself in the right mindset. That said, it is worth every penny. We stayed this past summer with our two young children and our nanny and had a wonderful time. It is the perfect combination of classic, old world grandeur and service presented in a modern, unfussy and genuine way. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The rooms are beautifully and simply decorated and the grounds are fabulous. All the reviews are true! I will add some details from a family perspective. Children are made to feel very welcome and is a ton of green space for them to run. Very important to us! My kids played with the life size chess set, ran through the gardens, swam in the pool and played at the on site",
Top top top 5* hotel,"I organised a business trip here for 25 partners for 2 nights in September. Our stay was absolutely flawless and perfect in everyway. The hotel is beautiful, a pretty little town and stunning views of the lake and mountain. A big hotel that really is a top luxury 5* hotel (when I say top 5*, it means it's got the finer details spot on). The rooms are lovely. I stayed in room 219 and it had wonderful views and a balcony. The service is impeccable, the staff are so friendly, they are at the same standard of customer service as the 5* star hotels in the Philippines, which is hard to match. The food is excellent, I didn't eat one bad meal, it was all just delicious. I have to recommend L'Accademia, their Italian restaurant, even the simplest pasta dishes are just so much",
Great!,"Staff is extremely friendly, rooms are awesome - clean, well designed and with a wonderful view. Top location, facilities, great restaurant and bar. Overall - one of the best hotels we've stayed in (and we travel a lot). A little complicated SPA area - it was hard to find the sauna. A bit pricy, but it's worth it.",
quality rooms quality staff quality food - very difficult to top it anywhere,"The best location, room, view, service and food one can imagine in a hotel. The location is first class and the staff are very professionally well trained. The view of the Lake is outstanding with the mountains on the other side of the Lake. There are many fantastic restaurants in town and the staff are happy to assist.",
"Beau Rivage Palace, Lausanne, Switzerland","Absolutly perfect in every way!!!! Professional, kind, friendly, and very helpful staff. Location on Lake Geneva is exceptional and beautiful. Easy walking to Olympic Museum and shops and restaurants in Ochy. Easy access to Metro for seeing city of Lausanne. Concierge staff are great and will advise and take care of all of your needs. Rooms and views of the lake and alps are super. I highly recommend The Beau Rivage Palace, Lausanne. I booked 5 nights the first week in Sept. 2015 and was so happy that I extended my stay twice and did not leave until the 13th of Sept. Staff made me feel like family and I am already planning my return. Cannot wait to go back",
"Swiss quality , french chic , Italian elegance ..","Beau-Rivage Palace is truly one of the best ,if not the best hotel in Lausanne. It is grand , newly renovated/ upgraded and chic! Rooms are spacious , airy (some facing the lake ) very comfortable/ good quality bedding .The stuff threat you as a royalty- courteous , very attentive to the needs. The restaurant was awarded with two stars in Michelin guide! Great place to stay for a special occasion or ..just treat yourself with a best;) ",
Great hotel in Lausanne,"This is a historical hotel and venue for many iconic event. Happened to have checked in during the weekend that the hotel was chosen as the venue for the historical Iranian Nuclear Talks. Fortunately was able to move in and out without much fuss despite the press, diplomatic corps and security staff. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, and the room is nice and quaint. There is a nice gym, with both indoor heated and outdoor pool. Will definitely recommend to friends considering a trip to Lausanne.",
A great place for a few days stopover,"A lovely hotel with beautiful views of the lake, an excellent indoor and outdoor pool and spa, large garden and green space and even a playground for kids. The staff was very accommodating of our young baby and the baby bed was very high quality. The rooms are newly renovated and comfortable though the doors allow for a fair bit of noise from the hallway. If anything to be improved it's the food. The breakfast is underwhelming for the price and the food in all the restaurants extremely salty. ",
The best hotel in Lausanne,"The Beau Rivage is the best Hotel in Lausanne. Even if we leave in Pully, we go there regularly. Located in Ouchy, front lake, fantastic view on the Alps, this hotel is excellent also for business lunches or meetings.",
"Nice property, Swiss prices","My family of 5 recently stayed for a few nights at the Beau-Rivage Palace in Lausanne.. Overall enjoyed the stay and the hotel, but couldn't help it was a bit over-priced, even for someone who has stayed at many hotels with eye-watering prices... The good stuff: 1) Great location on the water, near train into city centre, boardwalk with restaurants, boats for hire, playgrounds for the kids, etc. 2) Great pool area that the kids loved 3) Solid if fairly standard hotel buffet breakfast 4) Huge room(s) - we had two interconnected with equally large bathroom 5) Great view of lake and mountains 6) Friendly but refined service 7) Allowed kids to be kids without over-running hotel.. 8) Really no more classic hotel in Lausanne The few things that make me not rate this 5 star 1)",
"Elegant, beautiful, great views and location.","Room548. Very beautiful, elegant surroundings. Professional friendly service. Exquisite decor and very comfortable beds and pillows. The pillow menu is a huge plus. The pool is shared with the hotel next door and is rather small, however you can just walk across the road and jump in the beautiful lake overlooking the French Alps. Partial view of the lake from room 548. ",
"1st, 2nd & 3rd time - each is a charm","I stay here each year, which is bizarre for me. I love to try new hotels, restaurants, locations around the globe - but every summer when in Switzerland - this is the only place I book annually. From the bellmen, to the front desk, to the bar, to the restaurants, to the location, and most importantly the newly renovated rooms, the hotel is flawless. The views are amazing of the lake, and most rooms have nice balconies. I put my children up at the summer programme at Brillantmont boarding school so I can enjoy the spa (amazing !!) , pool ( attendants everywhere to help with towels etc..) and just to go through the private gate to the lake. It is one of my top 3 favourite hotels in the world...and each year it's only better !! (And the wi-fi is faster than even my own",
Superb!,"This is simply the most superb hotel we have ever had the pleasure to visit.We spent three wonderful nights in this fantastic hotel.Every superlative is deserved.The welcome from the friendly,efficient reception staff was very much appreciated and their help during our stay was outstanding.Our room was beautiful,modern,furnished to perfection and the bathroom was...STUNNING. The views from our room across Lac Leman to Evian were superb too.We enjoyed amazing service and food in the various wonderful restaurants from breakfast to dinner.SUPERB! Perfect location!",
6 star plus stay,"I had another fantastic stay in the Beau Rivage Palace. It can certainly recommend it for either Business or family travel. The reservations staff were super handling our difficult requests, the breakfast was brilliant, and the pool area was the highlight of this trip as an oasis of calm in the city.",
Renovated to Perfection,"The Beau-Rivage will meet and exceed all your expectations. Service is impeccable, and especially accommodating with children. The public spaces are immaculate as are the rooms with all modern amenities in the renovated wing. Plenty of dining options, indoor pool and outdoor pool. Gym with new machines and equipment. Delicious breakfast, just next door to the olympic museum. They even have an electric boat you can take out on the lake. Can not think of any improvements other than to continue the renovation to the other wing. On a day trip to Geneva, the concierge phones the Beau Rivage Geneva to take our car while we walked around, etc. Would certainly return if I found myself in the area again.",
Stunning hotel with views to match,"This is a hotel that gets it perfect at every level. The location is amazing , the style and ambience impressive yet very welcoming. We experienced interested and well trained staff. Alexander from Barcelona was attentive on our arrival and organised food and drinks whilst we enjoyed the firework display over the lake. We were there for a wedding and the food and service was up there with the best we've ever experienced. Our room was lovely, well appointed with a great view of lake Geneva. Breakfasts were probably the best we've had in terms of high quality product, well presented and an enjoyable experience each of the three days we stayed . If you want to spoil yourself and someone special, this hotel does not disappoint. Rightly deserves its high reputation.",
Fabulous Old World Charm,"My wife and I loved this hotel in every way. The attention we were given by all the staff was wonderful, our room beautiful and comfortable...and large (including amazing bathroom and closet space). Breakfast was remarkable and included in the pricing. We loved eating there so much, we ate dinner there as well and found it delicious in every way. The hotel setting is gorgeous and we took many extended walks around there each day we were visiting.",
Beautiful Hotel,"One of the nicest hotels I have seen. Great location, next to gorgeous Lake Geneva. The food in Hotel restaurant was pricey, but good. Shower in hotel makes you feel like you are showering under a waterfall.",
Excellent,"I last stayed here in July 2013 and described the hotel as excellent. Two years later it is still excellent with wonderful and comfortable rooms, great service and fine food. A huge thanks to all the staff who made our stay so memorable . The rooms overlooking Lake Leman incorporated everything you need in a 5 star establishment, the swimming pool area was well run as was the spa and gym, all within a short distance and very functional.",
a little bit of heaven,"Just amazing. Rooms, service, pool, food - everything was amazing. Top class hotel, which makes you feel welcome and at ease. Absolutely nothing to fault, and everything to praise. Made us, and our over enthusiastic 3 year old feel incredibly welcome, and with all the facilities, and amenities including play room, boat to rent, snacks, etc etc just brilliand",
A great hotel in Lausanne (Ouchy)!,"Very upscale, very comfortable and well situated, although a bit pricey. Everything about the hotel was first class and very classic modern. Great views of the lake, and close to many restaurants, activities and shops. A short walk from the metro, and close to the Olympic Museum. Staff was very helpful.",
Perfection,"This hotel is set in the most beautiful location on the shores of the lake - every morning is a delight waking up to this view! The hotel decoration and attention to detail is superb - and the menus are just outstanding. The staff are very warm and welcoming. It is easy to navigate the town, the metro and enjoy walks along the shore, and always so lovely to get back to the hotel for a relaxing evening in such a magnificent setting.",
Grand old European resort hotel,"Perfect in every way. Huge room with wonderful balcony, luxurious bedding & furnishings, amazing indoor/outdoor pool, gorgeous spa. Excellent food in numerous restaurants, esp the 2-star Michelin which is a pure gourmet experience. Great garden. Get a lake view room and enjoy the feeling of being at a 19th c luxury lake resort that's totally updated with no detail forgotten. Enjoy!",
Laid back,"Checked in at the Beau-Rivage Palace and stayed for 3 nights. This hotel truly stands out as one of the top lakefront resorts. Service is outstanding and staff are very professional and take the extra mile to make sure that the stay is unique. Rooms are classic and spacious. Top notch, would definitely come back.",
Good in parts,"On the plus side, our deluxe junior suite was large, with a balcony and great views across the lake. The en-suite bathroom was massive too, which made the tiny coffin shaped bath-tub squeezed into a corner so disappointing. Also, at this level, one expects marble or granite to be used, rather than ceramic tiles....and the walk-in shower stall, while large, only had a wall-mounted hand-shower fitting, rather than a proper overhead shower-head. Mattress gave poor support, and for some reason they provided two single duvets on our king-size bed. On the positive side, the buffet breakfast was excellent, and the staff all friendly and helpful. Pool-side loungers were distinctly average. We used their valet parking service: at our previous hotel (the beau-rivage in Geneva) there was",
The benchmark for world class hotels,"From check in to exit the service level was of the highest quality. The buildings are frankly stunning, the facilities top notch, and the location a dream for lovers of lake and mountain views. The breakfast setting, quality of food, was exceptional. Lucky with the weather (dry and 26 degrees) was icing on the cake - late evening drinks outside at the bar, a pleasure. This hotel is owned by a wealthy Swiss family (Sandoz) and it shows. Thanks folks!",
Stunning!,"A very elegant hotel with a magnificent lobby. Everything about the hotel was five star. The rooms are exceedingly comfortably - the dining experience was just that - the risotto I had is probably one of the best I have every eaten. There is no real downside - other than the hotel doesn't quite reach down to the lakeside but maybe that is more of an advantage - as Lac Leman was a little smelly when we were in Lausanne. The hotel was most definitely the best thing about Lausanne - Lausanne not my favourite place - taxi drivers rude, expensive and unhelpful. But the hotel and its staff most definitely compensate. Would I stay there again - of course who wouldn't just a shame it is in Lausanne.",
Beau-Rivage Palace - a dream,We spent an unforgettable weekend at the Beau-Rivage Palace Lausanne. Everything was just perfect. Nothing is ever a problem there. The staff were exceptional. The food was excellent. The spa was incredible. Really recommend Anne Sopie Pic Restaurant.,
GREAT HOTEL - flawless,"This is a great place to stay - the rooms have been refurbished and are now excellent. The service is very good - attentive yet discreet. The food is excellent and the facilities are generally very good. I ave stayed there about 5 times, and the only thing I do regret is that they do not seem to recognise returning guests.",
Beautiful setting,"Had lunch here on the lovely terrace, overlooking the lake It's a spectacular setting Very good food and polished service, as you would expect from a luxury hotel.with every attention to detail. All the staff were so helpful land polite. The hotel is beautiful inside, with beautiful gardens to stroll in, just a few steps from the lake. They made an amazing Bellini ! Truly memorable Can't wait to go back again and next time stay longer ",
Beau Rivage goes above and beyond,My family of five just finished a four night stay at beau rivage. BR is an amazing hotel. The rooms are gorgeous and immaculately maintained. We were in two junior suites. The breakfast buffet is outstanding with exceptional service. The terrace is a great place for a late night drink or coffee also with very attentive service. The concierge staff is among the best we have encountered. They are knowledgable of all things Lausanne, over the top helpful with touring recommendations and have a very friendly way that doesn't make you feel as if you are an inconvenience. The spa and pool are very nice and again have very friendly and helpful staff. BR is an exceptional hotel with a staff that goes above and beyond. 
Amazing location an service.,"We reserved through Tablet and had a wonderful stay. We had a Superior room overlooking Lake Geneva. From the fruit plate greeting us to the complimentary Metro/Bus passes we had a great stay. Make sure to have them explain the various amenities - e.g. the complimentary electric boat for guests to go around the Lake. You need to make a reservation and they fill up. Also, there is a difference in the bars so if you get a welcome drink make sure you go the right bar. The Spa/pool area was amazing and they even had a Falconer on the grounds. The hotel is centrally located and the areas around are great to walk about.",
A true luxury hotel!,"This hotel is absolutely magnificent. I stayed here in June 2015, and it is one of the best hotels I have ever visited (topped only by Katikies in Santorini). From the moment you check in, you feel you are in good hands, as the service is out of this world. The rooms are beautiful and the beds are extremely comfortable. The terrace bar and lounge has a stunning view of the lake and mountains, and the falcons present (with trainers!) to keep the pigeons at bay always made for a good talking point. Breakfast was included in our stay and was a huge selection of tasty items, enjoyed on yet another terrace. The service was great then as well. We did not have a chance to eat at any of the other hotel restaurants, as they were booked up, so reservations a few days in advance are",
"Luxury, service, setting, food!","This is a truly wonderful hotel. The welcome and service is gracious. The setting is spectacular with a beautiful view of the Lake from our balcony. The hotel has such an old-world luxury feeling, a pleasant change from all the high tech hotels sprouting everywhere. The indoor-outdoor pool is a delight, as is the sauna and hamam. Every turn found a hotel employee ready to advise and help. And the restaurant!! Mme. Pic has it just right, so much so that we were having our sumptuous cheese course at 1 o'clock in the morning while finishing out delicious 20 year old Bordeaux. We only spent one night and departed after a lovely breakfast buffet the following morning. But we will return. Very highly recommended.",
Everything was perfect. The best hotel we have stayed yet.,"Everything about the hotel was perfection. Where do I start? We stayed for a weekend to celebrate our anniversary. Pros: - One of the best hotels I know and have stayed in. The level of luxury is just out of this world (and we always stay in 5 star hotels!). My husband and I still talk and think about the hotel from time to time. - Lobby and service were perfect - Gym, pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi were beautiful, classy, quiet. We totally recommend the walk-in automatic shower, I think it's called rainforest shower - The decor of the bedroom was so classy and beautiful. The bathroom mirror even had a tv integrated in it. - Breakfast was good. The best eggs benedict I've had in ages. - Staff celebrated our anniversary with us by bringing tons of fresh juices,",
The best location in Lausanne," Wonderful view, perfect service and traditional rooms with all the latest technologies incorporated. The breakfast terrace and the quality of all what is served are a great match and invite for a long breakfast. No need to say that this hotel is for Lausanne visitors that travel without any budget restrictions.",
Super Hotel,"One of the best hotels I know. Especially the Palace-Part is an outstanding combination of historical building and modern design. What ever Restaurant you Chose, each one is fantastic in his way. The behavour of the staff is friendly and competent- simply outstanding!",
Thank you Michael....,"Some years ago Michael Winner described the absolute luxury provided by the Beau Rivage Palace. Then it seemed an impossible dream. But with low cost direct flights to Geneva and direct trains from the airport to Lausanne (about 45 minutes) it is now within compass. It is of course expensive, but it does give value for money. Our refurbished balcony room overlooking the lake and mountains was elegantly furnished. The service provided by the many staff members was impeccable and without formality. A late check-out allowed us to enjoy our last day to the full. Unreservedly recommended.",
Excellent Hotel,"A very hospitable hotel located in one of the world's most scenic areas. Since attending an exceptional family wedding reception in 2010, we have chosen to holiday at the hotel every year our schedule permitted.",
Good taste is luxury,"Good taste is the fundamental luxury at the Beau Rivage. The setting is idyllic, overlooking the lake and mountains in the distance; in front of the hotel as you walk to the lake is a pretty rose garden. The hotel itself is decorated in a quiet but confidently opulent style. Our room was all soft blues and creams, with comfortable classic furnishings, and a little balcony. The service was attentive, polite, thoughtful. Very good breakfast. You could spend part of the year at the Beau Rivage, as if you were taking a 19th-century grand tour, and feel at home.",
Excellent Hotel - beautiful location.,"The Beau-Rivage Hotel in Lausanne is located on the shore of Lake Geneva. The hotel is big and beautiful. The rooms vary in size, and all of them are extremely well equipped. The WIFI is free and it works!! The food is excellent, but it is a little disappointing that it takes more than 10 minutes to fry two eggs for breakfast. Other than that the hotel service is impeccable. The Beau-Rivage Hotel comes highly recommended. It is not cheap to stay here, but I think it would be difficult to find a better hotel. ",
Best of the best!,"One of the best I've ever stayed in, Classy and deep heritage, best food ever! Except for Miyako ( not impressed) but if you stick to the hotels main outlets you will be extremely happy! Fantastic pool and view, beautiful interior designs to the newly renovated rooms! With also fantastic view! Great service and professional staff. Except for one staff that seems he didn't know what he was talking about :S Over all a top rate!! And the only hotel worth staying in when in Lausanne!!!! ",
Beautiful grand hotel,"Huge beautiful luxury hotel by the lake. The grounds are gorgeous and amazing. The superior room is spacious with large bathrooms, tastefully furnished & decorated. Very good breakfast with lots of options. 5 star service and amenities. My only complaint is that the room near the service corridor such as room 548 is noisy especially in the mornings from the constant opening & closing of the door and movement of staff. Perhaps those rooms need to be soundproofed. Overall will gladly stay here again",
wonderful!,"Beautiful grand hotel- just perfect. Great service, great room. Bedroom was very comfy, bathroom was huge. Definitely get a room with a balcony overlooking the lake- the view is amazing. It's pricey, but worth it. It's outside of the old city, located right on the lake- a great spot.",
Awesome,"This review will be short and sweet. This hotel is awesome. Incredible location, great service, beautiful views, excellent restaurant, amazing amenities... Enough said. (There's a 200 character minimum, so I'll add that I have about 75-100 hotel nights per year at all levels around the world. This is my favorite. If you can swing it, stay here.)",
A gorgeous place to stay...,"I can guarantee that you will be impressed by the high quality service, the friendly yet polite staff, the beautiful scenery of the public places like the lobby with its atrium, the perfect gardens, the élégant bar, their relaxing spa... And of course their beautiful and confortable rooms ! You will definitely feel like home... And you'll never want to leave! (Their breakfast is AMAZiNG! ) A spécial mention to Andrea at the front desk, who was very helpful and friendly. ",
Flawless Experience,Stayed 3 nights at a work-related event with my wife. One of the more spacious rooms we have ever had in Europe. The room had a great view and was very clean. The blackout shades are awesome. The bars are both very nice. The concierge was incredibly helpful. The only negative was that you only get one key to your room which is difficult when two people are using the room.,
Really superb,"A stay at this hotel is truly an experience. This is really how a hotel should be. It is definitely not cheap and some of the rooms are a bit too small, but the ambience is always there. Great breakfast, great service. Try to get a room with a view of the lake and the mountains!",
A gorgeous first class hotel!,"The Beau Rivage Palace is a simply gorgeous hotel. The interior has been well maintained, yet the hotel holds onto its historic past. It's everything one wants in a true five-star hotel. The service is impeccable, the rooms beautiful, and the buffet breakfast is fabulous. I highly recommend the Beau Rivage to the discriminating traveler!",
First class hotel on all counts,"Attending for the annual FT Commodities Summit. Have visited for the past 4 years and this hotel is a true delight - highest quality service, location is first class, rooms are beautifully appointed in a traditional style with spacious luxurious bathroon. I swim so the spa and pool are most welcome where service is very polite and facilities superb and luxurious. I have to list his as about the best hotel I have stayed at around the world!",
Such a gorgeous hotel.,"We were there for a IMD conference. I knew it as a famous five stars hotel and also one of hotels world leading. Yes, it is. We got a room with amazing lake and mountain view, my room was spacious with sofa and balcony. It was perfect for relaxing. The breakfast buffer was so delicious with open view. We enjoyed it. The staffs were friendly and helpful.",
Amazing,"Went with the family for a weekend during Easter. We have stayed several times but it just gets better and better! Kids are well looked after and welcome everywhere without it being a ""Club Med"". Try the new Tepanyaki! Friendly, beautiful surroundings and an incredibly beautiful Palace. We will keep coming back.",
An Amazing Palace,An amazing palace with a service of high quality. The view on the lake is stunning! It is worthwhile for a week-end. There is also a small swimming pool and a hammam in the changing room. The place is quiet and perfect for a romantic night!,
Beautiful hotel in gorgeous surroundings,"This hotel is just gorgeous. The interior has been well maintained with keeping it's original beauty of a palace in tact. The breakfast buffet it incredible ! And service is perfect. The rooms were quiet and just lovely. Peaceful, relaxing stay even though as it turned out, there were peace talks going on in the hotel at the time of our vacation. So, LOTS of extra security. We still felt the warm nature of this hospitable staff.",
Palatial in every sense!,"Utterly faultless!! The hotel is a delight, stunning location with breathtaking views across the lake. The decor and facilities are the epitome of luxury with service to match. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and would not hesitate to return.",
Outstanding in every way,"Stayed here 6 nights. Felt like a princess indeed. Service over the top. Staff bent over backwards to be accommodating. I'm sure they didn't always feel like smiling but they did! What a pleasant experience. It meets my approval as ""one of the leading hotels of the world"". Bravo.",
Classic beauty and great service,"The Beau Rivage Palace maintains the charme of a classic, elegant grand hotel, with all the modern amenities. Set in a beautiful property, large garden/park with a splendid view of Lac Leman, we felt right a home: The enthusiastic receptionist that accompanied us to our room, the concierge, bell boy, waiters, spa staff, maids, all of them were very attentive, quick, professional and, I had the impression, proud to work at the BRP. (Compliments, quite a change to a few years back, when we had a few so so interactions) The rooms are beautifully redone, in classic style, with ample space in wardrobes and the bathroom. Opt for a lakeview room, it's great to see the morning come up from your comfortable bed. Nice in- and outdoor pool and beautiful spa. The only point: the men's",
The best of the best,"We just completed our 3 night stay in Lausanne at the BRP and I must say that everything is first class. The service in the hotel from the reception, bell boy, concierge, valet and waiters in the restaurants is outstanding. We had a lake front room with connected room to our children. The rooms are very tastefully decorated in a luxurious way. There is a pillow menu to choose how you would like to sleep. The spa and pool is also outstanding and we used it each night after our day touring. Nice relaxing way to end each day. We ate twice in the hotel and the food was excellent. We ate at Sophie Pic with room service for our kids and the whole family ate at Beau Rivage Cafe another night. The morning breakfast buffet is also delicious with a tremendous assortment. On our trip",
Practically perfect,"Beautifully appointed rooms in a stunning property that combines the grandeur and elegance of days gone by with 21st century amenities and outstanding service. Our room was beautiful: tastefully furnished and so very comfortable. We enjoyed some time at the spa and, again, wanted for nothing. Every aspect of the hotel exceeded expectations. Without exception, every single member of staff we encountered did their very best to deliver outstanding service, discreetly and efficiently. The only gripe: 35CHF per day for parking seems a touch miserly given the calibre (and cost) of this property. This small niggle aside, everything about our stay was perfect and I can't wait to go back. ",
Leading hotel in the world,"At the very moment, I am sitting at the hotel bar, drinking a well-made cappuccino and relaxing in an amazing atmosphere made more unique and special by a pianist playing for the guests. Some people are reading the newspaper, others are working on their laptop, but all of them look satisfied by the excellent service. At my arrival, yesterday, a gentleman took care of my lugguages and welcomed me professionally. A young lady from the reception came to the room and showed me all the services, answering all my questions and doubts. The room was surprisingly bright and the details made the difference; sewing kit, shoes bags, all languages tv programs, a great Bulgari “linea cortesia”. I immediately went to CINQ SENSES SPA and that also was a great surprised for me. This morning,",
Very nice Palace,This is truly a nice classical Palace with all that you would expect in a country reputed for its service worldwide. The food was very good and the view from this hotel is amazing. The garden is very pleasant and we appreciated the sunday brunch. The room is luxurious and offered a magnificent view on the Lake. The italian restaurant downstairs is also very good.,
I just have one word : splendid !,"We had a great moment in this hotel. Friendly reception. The staff is fantastic and very helpful. We got an upgrade with a nice view on the lake and the mountains. The breakfast is very good also. It is a relative small buffet, but there is a large choice of meals that you can order. The staff brings you a basket with bread and Croissants. Perfect !",
True luxury!,"Everything about this hotel is expensive - everything. Think US $50 for a hamburger and fries! However we found that nothing in Switzerland is cheap so you might a well enjoy that hamburger with a beautiful view of the lake and the alps! We loved our room and while small, it was luxurious and had air conditioning which is not always available in Swiss hotels. I was a bit disappointed in our view room (lake/alps view) as we were on the 1st floor (one floor up from reception) and these lower rooms lose some of the lake view by trees. I would recommend you ask for a high floor for a better view. The location of the hotel is fantastic and there are many great restaurants within walking distance that are fantastic. It's also nice to walk across the street and walk along the",
Outstanding,"I love this hotel. Everything is outstanding - restaurants (all three), rooms (sometimes small, but all very good), service, building, location. The only bad thing one can say is that it is expensive. It is a pitty that the good things in life are so expensive.",
Truly one of the best hotels we have stayed in!,"Speechless. Welcoming, warm setting, world-class service. The decor is amazing, especially when we went during christmas, amazing location near the lake. Expensive room, but it's what you would expect when you stay in this kind of accommodation. The spa is also amazing. And not to mention the top notch breakfast! We will certainly be coming back here - it's made our stay amazing!",
Outstanding! A six star experience.,"Can't not say enough about our stay at Beau-Rivage Palace. From the very first moment the staff greeting us as if we were their only priority. The Palace itself is a must visit even if you don't get the privilege of staying. Our room was a junior suite over looking Lake Geneva with a breathtaking vista towards the snow topped mountains. We ate in the Cafe for lunch choosing traditional chef favourites, delicious! It was a Monday night that we stayed which meant the restaurant was closed however if breakfast was anything to go upon, I can only imagine why it has a Michelin star. Breakfast was the best we've ever experienced in years of travel. However, the most outstanding thing to say about our stay was the staff and their friendly amazing service. Having waited too long for a",
Palatial style for the matching price,"Hands-down, this is a fantastic hotel: the décor is amazing, fantastic interior design, amazing location, and service is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel (and the price-tag on the room). The hotel is composed of two main adjoining palaces linked together: having stayed in a room on the second floor of the ""farther"" palace, I should warn that this does require some more walking time to the hotel amenities than the palace where main reception is. However, the room had clearly been renovated recently, with an extremely comfortable bed, light décor and a fresh bathroom that includes, amongst others, a TV behind the mirror where you can watch the news while brushing your teeth. My room was facing the back, but if you can manage to get a room facing the lake I am sure this",
High Tea at the Beau Rivage,"The ad claims: ""So British! Cosy sofas, a welcoming and warm setting and attention to service: this is the ideal combination for an afternoon tea"". However, if you like cold scones, little sandwiches right out of the fridge served in a former hall with generous side draught air, this is the place.",
Oui to Beau-Rivage Palace,"We were bumped to this hotel, as our hotel was closed until after the holidays. It was a one night stay, and it was just lovely. The staff made us welcome and service was top notch. They honored the price of our hotel, and gave us an exceptional room with a view of Lake Geneva. We were offered a room in the traditional part of the hotel or the renovated part. We opted for the traditional part, and were not disappointed. Even so, the desk clerk, said we could change, if we were not satisfied. There was complimentary water waiting for us in the room. The bathroom had a jacuzzi bathtub, as well as Bvlgari products, and terry cloth robes. The room had cathedral ceilings and a tapestry on the wall, and a large balcony overlooking the lake. After a shot tour of the facilities from",
Yes - this was a great stay to end a year with extensive travel,"saved the best for one of my last hotel stay of this busy travel year. Besides that my navigation system guided me to the front of the hotel ... entrance is the other side ... the stay and the experience was fantastic. Friendly welcome with this slight touch of french arrogance, great interior, beautiful Christmas decoration. The room quality and set-up (including turn down and room refresh, amenities in the bathroom) was great. Late drink at the bar - classy, stylish and traditional at the same time. Thank you Beau-Rivage Palace Team for the memories.",
Amazing!!!,"This would have to rate as one of the very best hotels in the world. We stayed in a room with a belcony with a small table and two chairs that allowed you to sit with a drink and soak in the view of the lake. What can I say the food here is just amazing, the bars, the location and the pool are just stunning. We were only here a couple of days and wished we had booked for a longer stay, but we will be back! This place U.S. not cheap, but certainly worth every cent. If you're looking for a wonderfull location with a sense of history and incredibly good food and service then this is the place you're looking for.",
Good traditional hotel,"Enjoyed my three days stay at this traditional Swiss hotel. Staff were friendly, breakfast was excellent and Internet worked fast. Three servers in restaurant, one each from Panama, Czeck Republic and Turkey, were very friendly and efficient. Housekeeping may need attention to small details. I discarded one pair of socks in rubbish bin because I didn't want them. The next morning when I was reorganizing my files on desk I found them on desk with a bunch of other papers I threw away to the rubbish bin. Housekeeping might have thought I might have mistakenly thrown them away by mistake. I didn't understand why the hotel insists not opening the gym earlier than 6:30 especially when the guest requests. Concierge said ""we always open at 6:30 and cannot open earlier than 6:30."" Can",
Elegant and stylish hotel,The Hotel is very old style stylish and yet very comfortable. A large choice for breakfast in an elegant dining room overlooking the lake. Our room was comfortable and quiet with a very modern bathroom. Situated on the lake it is a few metro stops or taxi ride into town. The receptionist was very helpful and there are a choice of restaurants within the hotel.,
Grand and ravishing,"I could give enough praise to the staff of this hotel, who keep it immaculately clean, running it effeciently and providing the highest level of service imaginable, starting from check-in. The property itself is at the best location of the city, in the secluded area from public promenade with its own park, but just 50 meters from Leman lake, with extensive SPA area with indoor and outdoor pools If you do want to experience legendary french service at its prime, you probably should get it in this hotel, and not in one of ostentatious upmarket Paris properties packed with nouveau-riches and marked by declining service. All in all, classy and gorgeous. And do have a meal (at least a breakfast) in the hotel, you will not be disappointed.",
One of the best hotels in the world,"My son is 8 years old and he loves the Beau Rivage. He's been a guest several times as a baby, toddler and young boy. I'm positive he'll keep enjoying this hotel as a teenager, young man and father with his children and grandfather with his grandchildren. Winter, spring, summer or fall this is the best place to stay in Laussane.",
My home in Lausanne,"My Home in Lausanne I’ve been often in Lausanne for the last 3 years (for business and to visit my son who is a student at the local university). Obviously, the location and the view are unique in Lausanne. But what makes me coming back is the amazing view, the choice of restaurants (all are pretty good!) and the staff. When you enter the lobby, you’ll be pleased to be recognized and welcomed. The lac, in front of the hotel, provides quietness and a very relaxing mood. Rooms are well decorated (ask for a newly renovated room), large and get the sun most of the day. The free WIFI delivers 36 Mbits /s. Breakfast, in La Terrasse, is ample and tasty. Tables are sufficiently separated to have a decent privacy. If you read a novel of Stefan Zweig while at The Beau Rivage, you",
Grandesse at Lake Leman,The Best Rivage Palace is one of the most beautiful hotels in Europe. It combines old style elegance with swiss comfort. Especially the rooms with lake view are spectacular. Several restaurants of different quality and price level offer food for every taste and budget. Fitness room ok but with limited equipment. Only opens at 6:30. ,
Tops in My List,"This amazing hotel/ resort is located on the shore of Lake Geneva in Lausanne. It is incredibly luxurious, one of the finest hotels in which I have ever stayed in the world. It has fantastic restaurants and an exquisite 16,000 sq ft spa; also an outdoor pool on gorgeous grounds. A significant feature that really makes this hotel impressive is the very high level of service provided by every staff member. It seemed like a well-dressed staff member just appeared out of nowhere every time I had a need or a question.The breakfast buffet was also beyond compare. My husband and I loved staying at the Beau Rivage!",
Pampered princess,"An historic hotel that lives up to its palace name. Beautiful and traditionally grandeur but rooms are fitted with all the updated amenities including a TV in the bathroom mirror. The bed and bedding was extremely comfy; felt like I was enveloped in a soft but supportive cloud. While our room was one of the smaller ones, the bathroom size was more than adequate. The hotel staff was accommodating and discreet; the service exceptional. We had a balcony room overlooking Lake Geneva with spectacular views of the Alps. BTW, the breakfast and service were beyond compare. Four days of being a pampered princess.",
Worthy of its top rating,"This grand hotel exudes old world charm but with modern amenities and decor. The room we stayed in was a bit on the small side but was luxurious and comfortable. The bed, duvet and pillows were so comfy that I didn't want to get out of bed. The bathroom had a built-in TV in the mirror over the double sinks, which I thought was a nice touch. The gym is small but well equipped and the pool and spa area are great places to relax. The service was top notch which is what you would expect from a hotel of this caliber. My only complaint is the dinner we had. We ate at the Italian restaurant in the sister property of the hotel next door and it was quite expensive for rather average Italian food. I ordered gnocchi and they were dense and heavy as a rock. I was also told that",
Exquisite,"Beautiful, historical hotel with fully upgraded and modern facilities in the rooms. There is an atmosphere of quiet luxury here, with tapestries, chandeliers, wood panelled lift and views of the lake. What really impresses is the high level of service provided by the staff. Unfailingly polite, friendly and courteous, the staff make the stay here even more pleasant. ",
What a Palace should be,"The Beau Rivage has managed to upgrade the historical Palace without falling into the annoying techno chic trend. What needed to be modernized has been with taste, what need to be kept is there. Very well done. A unique situation and a very diverse F&B offering. The staff is perfect",
True Luxury,"The Beau Rivage Palace in Lausanne is spectacular. This Swiss luxury hotel that sits on the shores of Lake Geneva. This hotel has operated since 1861 and is considered one of the finest in Europe. The rooms are very sophisticated and handsome; the halls and foyer are palace like. The grandeur of this hotel is hard to describe in words. The service, rooms, food, and view are all world class. This is a Palace.",
Pure luxury,"A historic building overlooking the lake, right near the Olympique museum, possesses also an incredible spa and has a nice choice of restaurants. You've got a feeling there... Something between being in a fairy tale and visiting a royal residence. The rooms are spacious, well-equiped, you never need to ask staff for anything. Great experience, strongly recommended!",
You certainly get what you pay for,"Excellent hotel. Wonderful situation on the lakeside. The staff are attentive and could not do enough for you. The rooms, especially the refurbished rooms, are superb, with all mod cons, electronic blinds and lights. Mirrors everywhere. Even tv in the bathroom mirror. Some rooms are perhaps not quite so lush, but they will be priced accordingly. Unfortunately the main restaurant was closed for holidays during our visit but there were three others to choose from. Huge spa and everything you expect from a five star hotel. There cannot be a better hotel in Lausanne.",
Beau-Beautiful with Par Excellence Service only way .,I stayed here in September the weather was amazing on arrival room was not ready was offered drinks in the amazing gardens overlooking the gardens and the lake .it certainly felt grand .I found my whole experience charming . I stayed in the new renovated rooms in the old palace wing.Every thing was catered for the walk from check in to the otherside was ozzing of charm and sophistication. I felt so comfortable the room was overlooking the side not a lake view never the less. Due to Longine Equestrian going on the hotel was completely full. But been tho it was full i never felt it was too busy . The Spa was amazing great gym facilities and swimming pool again the service was impeccable the hotel is like a resort with all of your whim taken care of. The breakfast and dinner was,
Perfection,"The Beau-Rivage Palace is a grand hotel with one noticeable difference – it works. Whereas other grand hotels have forgotten how to be ‘grand’ the Beau-Rivage has ensured that the elegance of yesteryear continues to be relevant for today’s modern traveler. Everything about this hotel is perfect, from the opulent common areas to the beautiful and luxuriously appointed rooms (I was in room 455), with their captivating views over Lac Leman. Any stay at this hotel is a privilege and it is a place that you seldom want to leave, tearing me away from my balcony to play golf was a struggle, yet returning to my room long after the sun had set to sip chilled wine on that balcony was something I thought about all day. My mornings started with a 2 kilometer swim in the outdoor pool and",
French butter - really?,"Had a quick snack at their bar during a day of meetings at the hotels. The bar and service are absolutely excellent. I went for the burger on the bar menu, which was a great choice. While waiting I was served bread with butter. Why does it have to be French butter in Switzerland? Plain, non-salted butter. I would have expected more Swissness. I understand that the foie gras comes from France, but the butter. Happy if the management gives me a good reason why French butter is better. Otherwise loved the experience at the house.",
A true Palace that has it all.,Outstanding Hotel coupled with brilliant staff. Having caught a train from Nice to Geneva then hiring a car to drive around Switzerland it was fair to say I wanted to get to this hotel as quick as possible to relax and unwind. My only regret? That I didn't stay here longer! It really is a Palace in all it's entirety of the word. The layout of this Hotel is just epic and you almost need to take a step or two back to take it all in. Being situated right on Lake Geneva it gives you absolutely stunning views of not only the back part of the Hotel but also the Lake / Alps if you manage to acquire a room with a 'lake view'. It is also only a 5 - 10 minute walk give or take to the city centre. It has four different areas to eat / drink which comprises of two cafe style areas &,
Truly a palace in every way,"As part of a trip for a European Delivery of a new BMW, we drove through Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland and stayed at the beautiful Beau Rivage. It is a spectacular property in a beautiful and convenient setting. Our very large room included flowers and wine to welcome us a beautiful large marble bath with jacuzzi and separate shower and a spectacular view of the pool and lake. Hotel staff warm and helpful, breakfast was included Several restaurants available to choose from and a lovely outdoor bar overlooking the pool and the lake. A real treat.",
More Than Excellent,"A beautiful historic hotel in a beautiful park with interesting statues and ponds. The attitude of the the staff made us feel as if we were the only guests at the hotel. Very good restaurants and bars. Comfortable room with fascinating lake view. Located by the Lake Geneva the hotel is very near the port, the bus stop and the subway. Free public transportation with Mobilis Card which we received at check-in. At the Bar you will find a wonderful book on the history of Beau-Rivage, worth reading. Take your time to visit the cemetery for dogs in the park. Coco Chanel's dog is one of the dogs burried here.",
Simply perfect,"Lovely location, amazing rooms, great service, pampering spa, delicious breakfast. The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was the cleanest I've ever seen. The view from the balconies is simply breathtaking. What else can you ask for?:) ",
Gorgeous hotel,I didn't intend to stay here but was so glad that I did. Huge lobby and a ludicrously small (and temperamental) lift. The rooms were huge and stunning whilst the staff were charming. I can't wait to return.,
Superlative,"Nothing not to like. Super location overlooking the lake, historic palace hotel excellently refurbished to high standard. Bedrooms wonderful with even tv built into the bathroom mirror! Staff throughout can not do enough for you and their training shows. State of the art Spa and great swimming pool. Hard to think of anything wrong!",
Fantastic 2-night stay on our way around Switzerland!,"The property is simply amazing! The views are fabulous! We stayed as a large family in one of their suites facing the lake and what splendour we experienced! The rooms were large, beautifully decorated in true high Swiss quality. The breakfast experience was simply divine - light and airy room with fabulous staff. The food choice was really excellent. The front office, concierge and bellmen were all fantastic. There is a small indoor pool where one can relax. Unfortunately didn't get to organise a massage as they couldn't fulfill a last-minute request. There only 2 slight negatives: 1. we dined at the Italian restaurant that is a 2-minute walk outside the main hotel. The service there was not quite up to the level of the main hotel. Food was average for the prices. ",
Fabulous Hotel,The hotel is a gem. The staff are extremely competent and helpful. The rooms are lovely and large and the views gorgeous. The pool and spa are excellent. The breakfast is beyond all expectations. Everything about the hotel is really excellent. You will be treating yourself to a wonderful stay by going to the Beau-Rivage Palace.,
Beautiful hotel and good service,"I usually don't like palaces, their impersonal (if not poor) service and their clients who often forget that money is not a substitute for good manners. We spent two nights at the BRP this summer and, while I won't comment on the clientele, I must say that everything that was under the hotel's control was very good. Every staff member we were in contact with was perfect, and many small attentions (such as the check-in package and the small bathrobes and slippers in the room) made our young children feel welcome. Our room (we were upgraded to a larger junior--suite) had been nicely renovated recently, and the view from the large balcony was stunning. Breakfast on the terrace facing the lake was another nice moment, despite the birds rushing on every piece of croissant that was",
Beautiful!,"The hotel was gorgeous, staff very helpful, food excellent! Central location across from Lake Geneva near train and Olympic Museum. Just check on room location. Ours was not on the lakeside and view was poor. Unfortunatly for us, hotel was booked solid.",
"Great hotel, bad service","Hotel with a great location, great amenities and rooms. Service was very lacking. On our check-in day we received our rooms at 6pm, well after when rooms are usually ready for check-in. We had to wait 2 hours after a long travel to get the room. The lady at the reception was rude and was not helpful. Service overall was slow. We were ignored several time when we asked the valet for our car. ",
Class hotel wth lovely views of Lake Geneva,"This is a traditional hotel, oozing class and history, we loved it! Excellent breakfast, well trained and friendly staff will cater to your needs. The choice of breakfast amongst the best we have experienced. The 2 star michelin restaurant was a little pricey for us for the evening meal, though you could get a set lunch for around 180 CHF (£120). The Beau Rivage cafe was ok for 3 course evening meal for around the same price and the swiss wines were quite nice 'Chabelais' (not chablis) about 42 CHF a bottle, remined me of the Monty Python 4 Yorkshiremen sketch! Anyway, you'll gather that you have to check prices and get the best value unless you are a millionaire, they know how to charge here, check outthe small teddy bear in the gift shop 680 CHF... The Italian Accademia",
Palatial Palace,"What a treat, this Palace is one of the most wonderfully maintained hotel, much higher than my expectation, views are breath taking over the lake and the mountains, what a staff, so regal, so upright, the staff are so friendly, warm, punctual, dedicated, they set the standard for everything else, the rooms are beautifully appointed, this is a true palace, say no more, just enjoy the moment and be here, from the well kept gardens to the many saloons, this is the elegance at its best. Restaurants, where to start from the Michelin awarded Anne-Sophie Pic or L'Accademia, just spoil yourself and enjoy the treat, the following morning you will enjoy for certain the breakfast outdoor in the gardens. In short you are looking at a 7stars Palace, I will be back soon",
First class in every way,Absolutely beautiful hotel in a gorgeous location. Rooms were elegant and comfortable with large modern bathrooms and every modern convenience. Our rooms had small balconies overlooking the lake and were truly perfect. Breakfast was beautiful and the service was top notch. Expensive 5* hotels that delivers on every front. Wish we could have stayed longer.,
Amazing location surrounded by a beautiful garden,"I stayed 3 nights with my family in a lake view room. The view was just amazing on the lake with the local weather changing so quickly from bright sunshine to heavy storms with lightning. I hardly watched TV instead I enjoyed the changing scenes on the lake. The garden of the hotel is quite vast and well designed with a beautiful outdoor and indoor pool linked with their famous spa. Breakfast is quite impressive with a big choice of breads, cereals, cheeses, meats, fish and fruits. There is also continental breakfast served if you want to add a few more calories! The hotel is a well established traditional palace hotel and was classed as one of the 5 best hotels in Europe, so do expect to have an elite to attend this hotel. The only down side of the stay is that there was no",
Just Lovely,"We just arrived home from 3 nights at Beau-Rivage, everything about this hotel is just lovely. The room was beautifully appointed, comfortable, and the bathroom was exceptional and included a heated floor as well as a TV within the bathroom mirror. I can honestly say I have never stayed in such a clean room, there were many windows and mirrors and the room was spotless our entire stay! The location is also terrific, just wish the weather had co-operated a bit more so we could have enjoyed what would have been spectacular views. The staff were friendly and attentive, and I can't fault this property in any way.",
Fantastic spot on Lake Geneva,"We stayed 3 nights at the Beau-Rivage Palace - BEAUTIFUL hotel and GREAT location in the quaint port-town of Ouchy. Very convenient to metro line and lake shuttle. Adjacent to the Olympic Museum (a must see!). Every morning, we walked along the lake to Pully and returned for a wonderful 1-hour escape from reality...there's no place like Lake Geneva! Drinks and snacks on the lawn of B-R cannot be beat...enjoy!",
Excellent stay,"Very warm welcome. Check in was efficient and I was accompanied to my junior suite (upgrade received) which included an in room sauna (which I enjoyed very much). Although the furniture and decor was dated (and sometimes worn out), the room was very clean with all the necessary amenities. I regretted not to have a coffee machine in the room, but that did not alter my impression. All personnel is very friendly and helpful. Will certainly be back to explore the spa and other services.",
World Class Hotel,"We had reservations for a Superior room with lake view, and decided to do the Anne-Sophie Pic dinner package.....As it turned out, the night we choose was a special event at the restaurant ""Soirée Millésime"" - after a few e-mails, we were able to ensure our reservations for this event.... One month later we arrive - after a drive in the pouring rain from Interlaken, in our Rolling Stones t-shirts and grubby jeans....to experience perhaps the most memorable 24 hours of our lives! The valets were fun and gracious, then as we check-in, we received an upgrade....to the Lavaux Suite! Room 423. The concierge provided a complete tour of the stunning hotel, and then escorted us to the suite...http://www.brp.ch/en/suites/lavaux-suite.html 3 short hours later we go to the terrasse for",
Didn't want to leave,"My wife and I enjoyed four glorious days and this five star hotel. The attention to detail was superb. The quality of the facilities (rooms, bathrooms, spa, pool, grounds, etc.) was what you would expect from a five star hotel...exceptional. The staff would go out of their way to satisfy any needs that we had. Obviously having a hotel on the shores of Lac Leman, with the Alps as a backdrop, is breathtaking. We strongly recommend reserving a room with a lake view if possible. This is the finest hotel that we have ever stayed at...we didn't want to leave.",
Extraordinary Hotel,"We spent two wonderful nights in June at the Beau-Rivage. From the moment our car was picked up to be garaged to the smooth and efficient check-in, including a personal escort to our room by a friendly reception staffer, we knew we were in a superb hotel. ""Elegance"" is the best word to describe the property. The hotel is georgeous and the views are superb. The room was beautifully decorated, the bed was large and very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. I cannot say enough about the incredibly friendly and helpful staff, all of them! For lunch, we were directed to the lovely lobby casual dining area facing the lake. The lunch was delicious and, of course, the service was very attentive. Our two breakfasts in the beautiful dining room were delicious with excellent",
Superb,"My wife and two young daughters recently spent a long weekend at the Beau Rivage Palace. It goes without saving that the location is beautiful. The hotel grounds are immaculate and the views of the lake are sublime. There was even a small playground at the hotel that our daughters enjoyed immensely. What surprised me was how nicely done the rooms are. Often hotels of this vintage are beautiful, but while kept up, they inevitably feel a bit old (I think the Le Bristol in Paris is like that). However here our rooms (we had a small suite and adjoining room) were beautifully done and felt clean, modern and spacious. We were on the fifth floor with gorgeous views of the lake. The service was superb as one would expect. While one or two of the concierge staff were not the",
Best place to stay in Lausanne,My family and i have high standards and we really enjoyed our stay. Make sure to get rooms on the right side of the hotel as you face the lake as they have all been recently remodeled. Its expensive but the location is terrific.,
"not my style, but great hotel","In my opinion the best hotel in Lausanne. Although it is not my style, but my last stye I've got freshly refurbished room and I must say it was very luxurious. On top of that on the second day I found in my room greetings with chocolates - very tasty surprise :-).",
Pure Heavan,"This hotel states that it is 5 star, and it definitely is just that. The service is outstanding - simply put, out of this world. Located on the shores of Lake Geneva, this august hotel boasts gorgeous vistas of the lake plus the surrounding mountains, and has a magnificent flower garden as well. The rooms are spacious, and has every luxury the traveller could possible need or want. Attention to every last detail is the hallmark of this very fine hotel. The buffet breakfast is just another superb feature of the many wonderful amenities of this great hotel. Staying at the Beau-Rivage Palace is an experience not to be missed.",
Beautiful hotel,"A perfect location, walking distance to almost everything. Love being so close to a promenade, the grounds are so beautiful. I read somewhere that Coco Chanel's dog is buried here I walked the grounds & found the small animal grave yard. The hotel is just stunning the tapestries, and grand staircases, the atrium on a rainy night was incredible & the bar on the main level was beautiful with great staff.",
utterly superb,"One of the best hotels in the world. we have been frequenting the Beau Rivage for many years and it is truly magnificient and enjoyable. It is pure pleasure to just lounge outside , read a book, bask in the sun, or even play chess on the garden-chess-board where you can also ride the metal donkey-statues... The rooms are impeccable, the Spa excellent , and the restaurants superb.... a great Lake lemans views all around.... superb.",
Magnificant! A luxury well worth the price,"Fantastic experience on a 3 day trip to Lausanne. The property and views are simply splendid all around the property. There have already been many comments made about the TV built into the bathroom mirror but it is worth mentioning again. I was pretty dazzled by that. I did not have a corner room, but still had a beautiful balcony that overlooked a courtyard that was quite nice. The elevator that comes up onto the back courtyard is pretty cool. The location is also spectacular as you can walk anywhere around it. Sadly I discovered the Olympic Museum too late. Definitely plan a trip there if you stay here. They are open until 6. The only disappointment was no coffeemaker in the room. I learned on the last day that you can request a coffee maker. Shoulda thought of",
Luxury defined,"Fantastic stay as usual, unfortunately got a corner room with no balcony and only the side view of the lake...but the TV built-in the bathroom mirror floored me! The bathroom was very bright and extremely spacious with some cool mosaic work.... I had to skip world famous Cinq Mondes Spa as they had only 20 minute slot which didn't fit into what i wanted to do, but hope to book much in advance next time round. The staff here are really faultless and the service is quite unmatchable in any part of the world. I had forgotten some of my stuff at the hotel and as I was in a nearby town I called them up and they said I could come and pick it up...they had it all packed for me. I really can't wait to go he hotel again! A most beautiful and relaxing stay...",
Runs like a Swiss watch,"I had a three night stay here in June 2014 (room 205). The Beau-Rivage is a lovely, grand old European hotel on the banks of Lake Geneva. The hotel has a pretty terrace area with a view out over the lake. The room I had was a basic one, but generous in size, with extensive wardrobe and drawer space. The bed was comfortable, with a good duvet, and the walk-in shower was powerful and, unlike some, that did not require an engineering degree to adjust. Lights are easily operated from a bedside control panel, and the TV was modern. The only thing I could suggest as an improvement would be more electrical sockets, especially at a convenient height. The breakfast is of an unusually high standard, with excellent ham and pastries, and eggs cooked to order. The reason that the hotel",
Incomparable,Our annual trip to this superb hotel. Once again we were not disappointed. I defy anyone to say a bad word about this exquisite hotel. Service outstanding - pure luxury. Unbeatable views over Lac Leman We will be back,
Amazing,"We just returned from five wonderful days in Lausanne. We stayed at the Beau-Rivage Palace, which vastly exceeded our expectations. I requested a renovated room with a lake view, as recommended on this site, and was upgraded to a junior suite at the same rate. It was beautiful! The view, the room, the hotel, the grounds, and the location- all spectacular. We thoroughly enjoyed the lavish breakfast buffet every morning. The service was impecable- especially that of a relatively new concierge who went out of his way to be sure that we had perfect information. This a lovely hotel and experience.",
THE BEST HOTEL EVER,"Amazing location, amazing food, amazing service It felt like home, the people are so friendly and are very helpful in every way I wouldn't mind living there I recommend this hotel to every person that visits Switzerland even for a day",
Excellent,"Beau Rivage Lausanne is the 2nd hotel of my swiss vacations. Booked by the hotels website. As i stayed 4 consecutive nights received an upgrade to junior suite 355. What a big room! Two sinks. Bathtube ,toilet and shower separated! Very good king size bed! Fluffy towels. Pillow s menu! A big window facing the beautiful lake,! Absolutely no noise from the corridors ,rooms or from outside ! And I am a light sleeper! Concierges efficient. Two options of breakfast,continental at 34,00 CHF. waiters at the breakfast very efficient,always asks if you need something extra. Veronika,the slovakian waitress, even remembered I don t like salt ,sugar and pepper in the table! The guys at the parking are nice too,specially Luis,the portuguese! They even asked if I want them to put my",
Well Run Luxury Hotel,"I enjoyed four nights at this classy Lausanne landmark. It has a special atmosphere and is beautiful in the sunlight, whether in the glass fronted breakfast room or in the extensive grounds. For me the highlights were the cuisine, location, friendliness of most staff and the spa area. The indoor pool looks nice but having the outdoor pool to myself each morning was a wonderful way to start the day ahead of a delicious breakfast. There were very few downsides, for example, this time the room was quite small compared to my previous visit and the curtains very light which meant waking in the brightness at 0540 each morning. However, if you are splashing out for a lake facing room with balcony you will not be disappointed. All in all I would love to return especially on a",
One night of Luxury!,"We stayed for one night in Lausanne during our trip to Switzerland. We were all wishing we had just remained in Lausanne instead of heading over to Geneva for a few days. It was hard to say good bye to the Beau Rivage. The staff was so friendly to us and our children. The moment that we got there, our whole mood changed to relaxation mode. My son took a pad of paper and sat on the balcony to sketch. The rooms were impeccable with high end finishes and beautiful views. After dinner at the Italian restaurant in the D'Angleterre, we tucked the kids into bed and turned on a PPV movie while we went down to the bar to enjoy a cocktail. The next morning while I packed up, the kids and my husband played a game of lawn chess and American Football with Lac Leman and the",
Five star hotel at its best,"This hotel has everything, beautiful property, refurbished amazing rooms, excellent restaurants and if your room faces the lake, amazing views of lake Geneva and the Alps. Suggest waking up early one morning to take a photo at dawn of the sun riding over the mountains. The staff is friendly and very helpful too. ",
Raid the piggy bank, stay here!,"Yes it's expensive, yes it's very grand but it is FANTASTIC! Sadly we are only staying one night but somehow we will get back at some time in the future. We are in a beautifully refurbished room with a balcony looking over the lake as the sun is rising and reflecting on the mountains on the other side. Five star location. The staff are so attentive and friendly. We had a light lunch in the lobby, dinner in the bistro, cocktails in the bar downstairs and everywhere the quality was top notch. Five star food and service. The room is just a delight with a lovely bathroom and robes which actually fit! Five star accommodation. Oh yes; the wi-fi is free (well, at the point of delivery anyway! Criticisms? Very few but why is the Sky tv link so strange? The video and audio link are"
I WILL BE BACK SOON,"I have wondered when I would be lucky enough to spend a few days at the Beau-Rivage Palace. Well it has finally happened. ABSOLUTE perfection, at every level. I travel for a living and have stayed in many fantastic hotels, this one is definitively all the way up there and I can't wait to go back. My stay was wonderful, every wish was a call away, warmth, kindness and humor… THANK YOU!",
Superbe,"Got upgraded into a junior suite. Freshly renovated, the room was really stunning. Without being flashy, but just very very good and neat. The view is fantastic and service top. Of course, full prices of the suite is quite expensive, but again one best room in any 5 stars hotel visited.",
Why can I not find more reasons to come here regularly!,"Luckily the Geneva Motor Show happens every year and that means I can come back to this absolute gem of a hotel at least once a year! Shame it isn't more often. I cannot think of many places that rival the Beau Rivage for location, sybaritic comfort, service and all-round pleasure. This year I was fortunate to be in the only suite that a roof-top patio and it was truly stunning - I can honestly say I haven't stayed in a hotel room that has its own staircase before! I've stayed in one with a piano, but not a staircase! And the whoosh with which the sliding roof opens to give you access to probably the hotel's best view is truly a ""James Bond"" moment.... The staff here are still at the very top of the game and every aspect of service is unmatchable. I can't wait for next year's",
Lakeside luxury,"On the first night I received some fruit, meringues and a bottle of wine. One the second I received fresh fruit, all wih cutlery and linen. This was just the icing on the cake for a great stay of two nights while visiting Geneva on business. The room - more an apartment - was large and incorporated the bedroom and a lounge with study, with a separate bathroom - unusually large for Europe but very welcome - with spa bath. Front counter personnel Leila organised an iron and ironing board (many thanks for that!) that made me even more comfortable. The hotel is huge and contains a selection of cafes and restaurants. It's also a close walk to Lausanne's (actually Ouchy) centre and edges the lake. Not cheap but the only place to stay if you need a rest.",
Afternoon tea was a huge disappointment,"We had really been looking forward to having a lovely afternoon tea at the Beau-Rivage, but were very soon disappointed by the level of service. We arrived well within the advertised hours for the weekend afternoon tea in the lobby, but the grudging welcome and overall lack of willingness to take our order made us feel that we were too much bother. When the tea did arrive, we were presented with what can only be described as tepid dishwater - any resemblance to English breakfast tea was at best passing. Then the plates and cutlery came - the napkin was damp and stained. It was replaced quickly enough. The sandwiches and cakes were of good quality and freshly made, so we were happy on that front. Overall it was a disappointing experience.",
Many disapointments,"Having stayed several times at this hotel for many many years (over 50), it is sad to see that the only thing that remains qualitative is the architecture and the garden. The service in the lobby is extremely slow and unprofessional. Had to wait for over 20 minutes to receive a simple tea and coffee order for 2 persons and on top of that, another 30 minutes to pay. Unacceptable, especially as is this was the case most of the time. One has the impression that students from hotel schools are used in order to save money and hence the ""quality"" of the service. The food is really nothing to write home about. Expensive for very average food. The Sophie Pic restaurant is nice but the prices too high, bearing in mind that Mrs. Pic is never there. The once voted best Spa is also",
Totally overrated,"We stayed at this hotel and do not understand the high ratings. The front desk was not very professional, rude and slow, the service in the hotel was bad. What really surprised me was the lack of training of the staff. The restaurants served ok food at a high price but again the staff working there did not have any concept of what they were serving. The rooms are ok, not 5 star quality but ok I guess. The hotel is in a nice location with nice views and I am sure that this has a positive effect on previous ratings. But the hotel as such is not worth 5 stars. It is not a hotel I will return to.",
Fabulous hotel!,"Spent 10 days in Switzerland during Chinese Spring Festival holidays and Beau-Rivage Palace just made this trip more memorable than I expected. The historical hotel locates on the banks of Lake Geneva which has a perfect view. The design and decoration both in the rooms and public areas makes the property worth a visit. When I arrived at reception late in the evening, I was warm greeted by front desk staff who quickly dealed with my check-in afterwards. Concierge helped me enthusiastically as well. No doubt the room was exactly like the website image showing, elegant, precious and stunning. I received fresh fruits, tea, even instant noodle in my suite room, while the breakfast in the second morning gave me a pleasant surprise which a set of Chinese dim sum was offered",

classic luxury and attractive location,the location on the shore of the lake and near the small port is excellent. there is free rapid connection to the old city by subway. we stayed only one night after a ski holiday and enjoyed the hotel. even our unexpensive room was very nice and rennovated. the hotel itself is luxurious and impressive and combines classic style with modern elements. some of the public halls are really palace pieces. the staff was nice and the total experience was very pleasant and worth the price.,
Great Hotel - Pricey,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in. Our room was excellent as it should have been at the price point (north of $650/night). As an example, the breakfast buffet was quite good, but again at CHF49 per person it should have been. Bottom line: very expensive, but you get what you pay for here.",
Splendid,"This hotel is wonderful , the location service and the gardens in the summer are just wonderful , one feels one could be anywhere the flowers and lush foliage are just exceptional. One of Switzerlands great hotels and still close to geneva . Right on lake Geneva with wonderful views of the lake and Evian . Perfect for business or pleasure couples or family . good choice of restaurants .",
Fantastic break,"We stayed only for a week-end at Beau-Rivage and really enjoyed it. I was alone with my young children and everybody was very helpful with us. After having spent a few hours only in the hotel every body was welcoming us by our name which gave us the impression to be at home. The breakfast is so great that I wonder if it really worth trying the brunch on sunday morning.... A great choice and fantastic quality. However, the outstanding point was the service. We are used to top ranked hotels but on that front it is clearly above standards (that are already high).",
Great hotel but not as Great as the price,"we visited this autumn. What I liked was: 1. the rooms 2. the amenities 3. gardens 4. view of lake geneva 5. the cafe has a separate menu for vegetarians which is a rarity in Europe 6. the ornate halls 7. staff was mostly polite and discrete what i disliked: 1. there were cobwebs in the reading lamps which was shocking 2. the spaghetti which I ordered in my room was so undercooked that it could not be eaten 3. breakfast didn't have sufficient options for vegetarians 4. receptionists seemed slightly haughty and chamber staff can be better trained the property is beautiful but when you pay USD 600 or more for a night, you expect the stay to be exceptional which it was not.",

Not bad,"I was really looking forward to staying here as I've heard so many good things. It was overall an average experience. The exterior: Looks great, especially from the lake side. 2 giant buildings connected by big public rooms. The public rooms: The front entrance and corridors are lovely but not awesome. The room: I stayed in a renovated lake view room. The view is great, and the room was very clean. But it didn't feel up to date. The TV in the mirror was cool, but kinda useless. It felt like a room from the early 2000s. The bathroom: almost as big as the room itself. It was The amenities: Bulgari everywhere, not bad at all.

Amazing Historic Palace-Hotel!,"This is a historic palace-hotel located by the lake in the Ouchy district of Lausanne. The view is amazing with Lac Leman stretchering to the distant Alpine mountains at the horizon. Lausanne peace treaty between Republic of Turkey and the allied forces was signed in 1923 in this hotel which makes it a special location for the Turks. The spa, rooms, service, shortly everything is amazing. You should stay at least one time in your life in this hotel.",
Difficult to find better,"We stayed here as a family of 3 for 3 nights and first impressions always start with reception. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room (459) had uninterrupted views of the lake and had been recently refurbished. We only stay in 5* hotels and have enjoyable memories of the Savoy for instance, but this hotel exceeds even those standards. We had a small problem with the blinds in the bathroom and as soon as I put the phone down, a staff member was at the door. The same applied when I requested an electrical adaptor - in seconds they we at the door with the correct adaptor. There was a TV built into the bathroom mirror - never seen one before - it looked like a blue square when it was not on. The TV's had many english ( and other language ) channels which meant",
Amazing Hotel,"Stayed here for a long wkend, where my now husband proposed. Amazing hotel, pool both out doors and in door amazing. The spa was great, service, cleanliness and rooms of very high standard. Its pricey but worth it as its an experience and if you can afford it then better to enjoy the luxury of this hotel while in Lausanne",
Lovely setting,The Beau Rivage Hotel has the most beautiful setting right on Lake Zurich. Our room overlooked the clear water calm water of Lake Zurich. The outdoor pool setting was private and the water was a perfect temperature to do laps. They also have an indoor pool with hot spa. Service was outstanding and the location is a short walk to the tram and the wharf. Highly recommend this hotel...it is totally a five star resort in everyway. ps. check out the droid lawnmowers that clip the lawn to a manicured length all day and then return to their base units to recharge when necessary. Fun to watch!,
Incredible hotel (but pricey).,"Great place to get away. Fantastic location with incredible views of Lake Geneva if you can score a Lake View Room. Good gym facilities associated with an out of this world spa and pool area. Good restaurants. Clean rooms. WiFi is frustratingly poor, but otherwise a great hotel.",
"Wow, literally a Palace!","Five star all around, you can tell the minute you arrive. Pull down a gorgeous private drive to the huge entrance doors, greeted by a bell captain who greets you properly and tends to the bags and the car. Enter the palace, see and feel the elegance and history. Escorted by the check-in clerk to our suite overlooking the lake. Our room was breathtaking, seemed out of a castle, huge chandelier, art, marble fireplace, 15 foot solid wooden French doors to a private balcony. Unbelievable. Now to the restaurants, one by French renown 3 Michelin star Anne-Sofie Pic, another French style indoor-outdoor, another that was haute Japanese, another in an adjacent building with fabulous pastas, wine and hearty fare. All decorated, staffed and presented for royalty. Not to mention the",
Simply Wow,"I stayed at this hotel for one night with my family, and we really loved it. I chose this hotel for it's location, as it's right on the lake. But boy were we in for a treat. The staff were amazingly helpful, I came with no booking and requested two rooms possibly connected because of the kids. And we got exactly what we wanted. They tended to every request we had. The rooms were gorgeous with a fantastic view. The beds are very comfortable. The place is an actual palace,and you can certainly get that sense. The garden is beautiful. By far the best breakfast buffet, great variety and selection, and an amazing service. Even my kids who are picky eaters, really enjoyed it. I would recommend this hotel to everyone, and I would surely go back there soon.",
Paradise Re-Found,"Going back to the Belle Epoque splendour of the Beau Rivage Palace is like having a re-union with a very good old friend of the old school. The time you have been away is unimportant, as you know that the values, the traditions and all the things you like, are going to be exactly the same as they were last time, when they were absolutely to your liking. So it was for the long weekend we have just experienced and our views that this must be one of the best hotels in the whole of Europe remaim unchanged. It was the weekend of the Lausanne Horse Show and the hotel was totally full but thankfully we were able to secure a lake view room (a real must if you stay here), which though not as grand as the suite we had last time, was perfectly adequate and wonderfully comfortable.

A true 5 star hotel,"I Went for a 2 night business trip, one of the best hotels I have ever stayned in. A true classic European hotel, located right on the lake. My room was on the 5th floor at the renevated part of the hotel and the room was incredible. Designed beautifully, everything was tip top, bathroom and shower was a true dream (you have a TV build inside the mirror, very cool), however, one should bear in mind that if you are about to look at the prices, you better not, it is a real expensive hotel (Tea, 10 Swiss Francs) but all and all it is a true exprience, the people there a Class A business men, a lot of bankers, sheikh's, oligarch's and people that money is a no issue matter for them.",
Even better,"It's sometimes difficult to recognise a hotel from some of the ultra-picky comments on this site, so since I'm just back from a stay in one of the delightful renovated rooms I have some simple observations. This is one of the best hotels there is, bar none; and the staff are unfailingly charming and polite, despite whatever they may get from guests whose ""expectations"" aren't met. The employees manage to be informal and unstuffy despite the grand surroundings, and their friendliness combined with efficiency at reception and in the restaurants is terrific. The renovated rooms are beautifully done and stylish. They're not without one or two flaws: we had problems with the room door and with the panels over the bathroom windows, and the bath is a slightly awkward shape. But you'd",
Didn't meet our expectations,"Our first impression upon check-in was a bad start to our stay here. Before we arrived, I had requested multiple times (through a phone call, through emails and through AmEx travel) a renovated room, and also notified them that I would be arriving early (around 11am) -- because we booked through AmEx, we were entitled to check-in early. I do understand that these requests are subject to availability, but this is a huge hotel and it did not seem particularly busy or even close to full when we were there. We had booked a lake view room, and at the time, about half of the lake-view rooms were renovated rooms. When we arrived around 11am, the receptionist informed us that they did not have a renovated room available for us. I complained, and they said that if we waited for",
Perfect in every way,"I have travelled a lot and stayed in many places and this shines as the best by far. Gorgeous rooms, grounds, food and staff. The terrace breakfast is 49 CHF and worth every cent. The staff were helpful, friendly and pre-empted what I needed as good hotel staff do. Nothing to fault, I loved every minute.",
Distinctly Average,"We stayed at this hotel over the summer for a few nights. It is very average in our view. The positives were the location ~ the lake is beautiful and the views are very nice. The service was okay mostly and scraped into the average for us. The spa was wonderful! However the negatives for us outweighed the positives. The hotel was full, it was the weekend and the swimming pool area was packed, the guests were squashed in like sardines and hanging over everyone was a consistent grey cloud of smoke which was relentless. Some guests would sit and chain smoke the whole day and even in the outdoor restaurant would think nothing of lighting up whilst other guests were eating, it is terribly rude. It was a most uncomfortable experience as all of the seating overlooks the pool, most",
"Amazing location, showing some signs of wear and aging.","We've stayed here a few times over the last four years, and always enjoyed it. I'd have to say that (at least some of) the rooms are beginning to show some age. The shower in marble tile is a work of art, but the grout lines with pink tinged mold were a negative! The rooms have an awesome view over the lake, but the trees have grown up so that its mostly obscured for the first floor rooms. Each room has a balcony, and the doors open fully for a nice fresh air feel while sleeping. But the traffic noise from the lakeshore boulevard gets loud after about 6:30am on weekdays - have to close the doors to sleep in. Breakfast is an unreservedly awesome buffet. Restaurants are good. Staff are always super helpful - for example the waitress at breakfast who remembered us from last",

Lettuce ready for the recycling bin,"My wife and I arrived in Lausanne mid-afternoon on a very hot day after a long train ride and decided to splurge a bit and get a snack and drinks on the Beau Rivage patio. The hotel and its setting are incredible but that turned out to be a thin veneer. We sat on the patio accompanied by a number of dead flies on the sofa. I know the hotel can't control insect life, but you would think that when an ordinary 12 ounce beer (Konigsberg) cost 16 swiss francs and a small cheese plate is 22, the staff could sweep the flies off the seat befroe you sit down. But that wasn't the worst of it. Along with the cheese plate came a small salad. The lettuce was not just wilted but basically rotting. When we asked to speak to the chef about it we got a floor manager who said 'I am the",
great service but not very stylish!,"The service is very good, although one of our suitcases was left behind and we had to call back and find out where it was...

More than perfect,"We drove from England all day and arrived 16/8/13 at 4 pm.

Palace treats you like Royalty!,"The buildings are enormous, with grandiose public spaces, but the friendliness of the staff prevents them from being intimidating. The flower arrangements are stunning. We arrived early and were offered complimentary drinks while our room was being made ready. The very comfortable seating areas in the gardens are particularly spacious. The lakeside location is fabulous. Our superior room, with a beautiful view across the lake to the Alps, was quiet, comfortable and very well equipped, with electrically operated blind and awning. The rather small bathroom, though also well fitted out was a little tired. However, a comprehensive programme of renovation is in progress. The first 30 rooms have been completed and a further 67 will be available by May 2014. We did not see any of",

"Great Location, Not Great Service","The Beau Rivage is in a stunning location and has a fascinating history. However it is very expensive and does not always live up to its five star rating. Reception after a long journey to the hotel was efficient but cold. We were allocated room in newly refurbished part of hotel. My advice, go for a classic room. Far more space, proper bathroom and terrace. The receptionist who showed us the first room didn't appear to have been in them before as she could not operate air conditioning, didn't know where anything was in room. After walking the long distance to reception from these rooms the second receptionist was very charming and helpful and organised the classic room for us.

We were seated at table by the window with the most splendid view of the gardens, Lac Leman and the mountains beyond. The staff were most welcoming and the service was exceptional. Our glass of champagne arrived as soon as we were seated. The buffet was a culinary delight with so many mouthwatering choices, all displayed like works of art. I must add that the journey tasting many of these delights was a joy. For the little guests the Easter Bunny arrived with chocolate eggs. This experience was definitely worth the price, I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are looking for exceptional food, service",
Lap of luxury,"Incredibly expensive, even by Swiss standards. But the level of service, the attention to detail, the tastefully furnished rooms and the beautiful views make it worth it for a splurge. The one quibble I had was that the balcony of our Junior Suite was very narrow--barely deep enough to accommodate a small table and cafe chairs. So not as comfortable as I could have wished. But a great experience overall. ",

The best of the best!,"I was very grateful for being able to visit this hotel for a conference. I have not enough words to describe the quality of the hotel, both in terms of premises, facilities and its people. The room was wonderful (even for the ""ordinary"" room) with an excellent view and an excellent sleep quality. The bathroom was the cleanest I have ever seen. The breakfast buffet was full of positive surprises with a unique touch. The premises are so nice I found myself starring at walls, rooms etc. The staff was very polite and the checking in and out processes were quick and efficient. If we want to be very strict, the spa has some space for improvement, I have seen better spas at lower priced hotels. (But I am very strict here!) Overall, there is only one problem with this hotel: you cannot",
Best of the Best,"first time being in Lausanne. And this hotel has it all. Impressive maintenance of the more than 100+ years building and the service from anyone in the hotel is really impressed me totally. Room will be clean and arranged EVERYTIME i left the room, ur luggage will be moved to proper place, toiletries in a proper arrangement, my clothes even they help to fold it nicely, and your shower get, tower will be changed everytime i left the room. every request from follow up for my luggage lost, to special reqeust for my morning coffee was properly done. i would recommend this hotel if budget is not a concern, will definitely come back if have chance. metro: Ouchy, last metro station, and im here for the whole week, the transport card is covered for the whole week. location: Ouchy is",
Elegant,"arrived very late at night after unsuccessfully finding my original hotel - which turned out to be on the other side of lake Geneva in France. The ambiance here is elegant - and the service and food make you feel special. In fact after speaking to the concierge about not finding my original hotel, he said...sir, please relax and let me take care of this for you.....he called booking.com and the hotel and managed to recover 200 euro's I though was lost. Well done. The breakfast room was fit for royalty with spectacular view and the food display, variety and taste was magnificent. The staff we very friendly and courteous. Bed: very comfortable Washroom: huge and well appointed Comfort: excellent Cleanliness: perfect I can't wait to bring my family here.",
"Everything - location, staff, elegance","The concierge staff service was beyond excellent, they planned a wonderful trip for me to Interlaken taking into account all my needs. The view from the balcony was so good I did not want to sleep...it was one of the best view's of Lake Geneva. Great place to relax. Great breakfast buffet and the toiletries from Bulgari were fantastic.",
"Beautiful hotel, wonderful new designed room but very soft beds :-(","We stayed here on a business trip in June and we were delighted to get the new designed room. Room was very beautiful with lake view, light colours, nice closets and night tables and the bathroom with a state of the art tv build in the mirror. Unfortunately the new beds are very soft, uncomfortable soft so that when my hubby coughed I thought to be laying on a trampoline. I would recommend the hotel to change this because soft is nice but like this is ruining the backs of the guests Roomservice food as well as the food in the restaurant was very good, service impeccable, we also visited the bar in the hotel for snacks and cocktails and the waiter was very friendly. The lady serving at the breakfast was a different story, very moody and she could not get the order right while",
Lives up to its name - Palace,"We stayed at Beau-Rivage in May and so enjoyed our stay. Service is alive! You were greeted every where from the side door to the elevator and the surroundings were just beautiful. The floral arrangements were magnificent and the breakfast was the best we experienced in Switzerland. We had a room with a balcony and seeing the lake and mountains each morning was breathtaking. My only comment was to be sure to ask for a classic room if you want decor as depicted on their web site. Our room was more modern for my taste but you can request a classic room when you make your reservation and if available, they will comply. This was our first visit to Lausanne and Beau-Rivage is perfectly located to walk every where. If you are not a walker they provide you with Metro tickets and",
"Wow! A Palace of Yesterday, Updated for Today with Amazing Service","I had the pleasure to stay two night for a business meeting at the Beau-Rivage Palace in Lausanne, Switzerland. All I can say is Wow! It is truly a former palace, kept in impeccable shape, updated to today's modern pleasures with great views of the lake, amazing service always ready to assist, a world of restaurant choices, plush rooms that you don't want to leave and a breakfast buffet that rivals my favorite at the Park Hyatt in Seoul. I can't wait to return to a hotel that is not a chain (like Four Seasons or Ritz) that include only standardized robotic servers in an overpriced hotel and dining establishment. This is an independent and is 100% better than the luxury chains. Whatever you do if you are in Lausanne, stay at this palace hotel. You won't regret it. I assure",
Convenience in a Luxury Setting,"We stayed here for 5 nights on a conference. Very high end and luxurious. We wondered if it was a little out of the way, but soon discovered that both trains and boats!! were at your beck and call. Beautiful setting on Lake Geneva. Swiss hospitality and service is amazing. The boat transport on Lake Geneva is covered by Swiss Pass and takes you to many French and Swiss destinations. We also took a trip to Gruyere which was memorable and very scenic.",
Wow - a luxurious accommodation experience,We spent two nights here and were impressed. The service and luxury is second to none. Get a nice room with a balcony that overlooks the lake otherwise you will not get the best feel. We took several hours just to fully explore this hotel and poke our nose through all the floors and all the different function rooms. It is a great wow experience. The day we left we mentioned at the breakfast we were travelling by car and the waiter immediately offered to pack a little lunch pack for our road trip free of charge. How wonderful. Breakfast was quite nice but perhaps a little less quality and variety than other 5 star hotels. The price of staying here is not for the faint hearted but it is truly an experience that will stay with you for the rest of your life. Parking was expensive,
"old-world decadence, lakeside","This could probably be an amazing destination for romantics and gourmands. Lovebirds: get a high-floor room - we had a room only 1 or 2 levels up from restaurant shadesails - didn't optimize the gorgeous views. Also the oil-stained brocade headboard from too many years of too many heads leaning against it was a turnoff (i moved the sofa pillows in front to hide them but turndown service moved them). Nonetheless, full moon from the little balcony was exquisite. Foodies: check beforehand to make sure their 2 high-end restaurants aren't closed - we were there on Sunday or Monday when they were both closed. The other cafe'-restaurant is fine but slow and over-priced. The spa staff were very pleasant, and the spa itelf was perfectly adequate although not as over-the-top as some",
"Beautiful place, delicious food, friendly staff","We have been to the Beau-Rivage Palace in Lausanne a few weeks ago, and were all (four adults and a small dog) impressed by the service. The rooms were comfortable, the staff was very friendly (also to our puppy) and the food was delicious in all of their restaurants and bars (we just did not manage to go to the brasserie). Also, the breakfast is amazing both in the room and downstairs! We would definitely like to come back!",
Lake & the city,"This is the case when I do not have any idea how to make the review. Just one word ""from the bottom of my"" mind - excellent !!! Bravo !!! This is all Swiss with french charm and german superb service. I was amused that such property could be the hotel for the ""public"". Choose the lake view rooms, relax in the spa, take drinks in the Bar, enjoy the dinner in any of the restaurants.",
Old world charm,Simply a beautiful hotel with amazing staff who can't help you enough. Great breakfast buffet lovely restaurants and great views of lake Geneva and the Evian alps. And of course Robo cop lawn mower you need to go and see him in action. If you are ever in Lausanne spend. Few days here its worth it for a beautiful hotel.,
An exceptional hotel with service to match !!!,"This to me is another of those incomparable hotels that you place in the ""Institution"" class. On the bank of Lac Leman facing the majestic views of the French snow clad Alps for some 150 plus years this hotel never rests on its laurels. Majestic would be just one superlative to describe this architectural wonder. A stroll down the inner corridor from the reception past the art deco bar reveals awe inspiring conference and ballroom facilities with workmanship the like of which will never be built again. The Swiss seem to have an ability to manage hotels like no others and The Beau Rivage certainly fits that description. Beautiful bedrooms and bathrooms with exquisite cotton down comforters and pillows along with everything you should have thought about in case you didn't is",
"Beautiful Palace, Cafe Beau Rivage and Fitness need improvement!","We returned to the beautiful Beau Rivage Palace for a weekend, we used to stay there before and we truly like the rooms, the location and the fantastic architecture of one of the most beautiful Palace Hotels in Switzerland. We kept fond memories of nice veranda restaurant with a beautiful view, well, they serve breakfast there now. The top restaurant, Anne Sophie Pic is, to my taste, too complicated and overpriced. A true disappointment was the dinner at the (usually) excellent Cafe de Beau Rivage, which offers one of the nicest terraces in Ouchy. The food was average, the service really poor ( nobody seemed to be in charge). While their SPA offers a very nice indoor and an outdoor pool, the fitness center is too small and the equipment dated. This needs definitively to be",
Two in one. Past and Present,"We have recently spent a 10 days holiday in this luxury hotel. Beau Rivage Palace is a unique hotel to stay with a great history. If you d like to feel yourself like an aristocrat you should definitely visit this hotel! We had two rooms and all of them was quiet spacious with great decor elements, new and charming furniture, but bathroom was unfortunately not so great... Nothing bad, but not for a luxury hotel. The staff was extremely friendly, courteous and efficient especially in Spa and restaurants. But, we had some misunderstanding with a concierge, when we have asked him to book a tickets in Opera House, he was extremely friendly, but had created a million of reasons why we dont have tickets on our hands as we promised - so all in all we just reject our proposal. ",
Incredible!,"I recently spent 2 nights on business in this hotel and can certainly echo the reviews of other guests. The service throughout the stay was absolutely first class. All the staff were friendly, polite and all had a great desire to please. The hotel rooms were well appointed, comfortable and all geared towards providing a first class stay for guests. As for the location, what more could you ask for sitting on the terrace, in the sunshine overlooking the mountains and lake geneva... Perfect!",
"EXTREMELY slow service, LOTS of patience required!!","I recently spent one night at the Beau Rivage on a business trip. There is no doubt whatsoever it is in one of the best locations in Switzerland and it is an impressive palace but that's all it has to offer. They do need to work on customer service. Take breakfast for example. They have just one person that greets and checks-in people at breakfast but guess what. Not only does she do that, she also has to accompany the guests to their table, accommodate them and go on with some chitchat and useless drivel, spending at times a full 5 minutes. At the same time, people are waiting at the queue, hoping to have their breakfast. I was right behind two groups of 4-5 people each and it took me more than 15 minutes waiting and during that time nobody seemed to care. They have staff",
Outstanding Hotel,"We have stayed here five or six times over the past ten years and have never been disappointed. If you're after an outstanding hotel with a great location and superb service - look no further. We had booked a three night break and from the moment we were welcomed at the front door the customer service was second to none. Due to us arriving slightly early, our room wasn't quite ready. However we were shown to garden area where we were given a glass of champagne whilst we waited for quarter of an hour. On returning to the reception desk we were informed that we had been upgraded from a superior room to a junior suite - wonderful. The suite was excellent and overlooked the Lake. Everything one expects from a top 5 star hotel was available - bathrobes, slippers, complimentary",
Truly Unforgettable,We visited the Beau Rivage Palace with my husband to celebrate our birthdays. I believe that it will be one of those get aways that will remain with us forever. The Beau-Rivage Palace is amazing and the hotel staff pamper you from the minute you set foot in the door! It is spectacularly clean and the breakfast is of very high quality. We particularly remember the freshly picked strawberries and fresh cream! I would no doubt recommend this hotel to anyone!,
Very good Hotel,I recently stayed at the hotel for a business trip and had an exceptional stay. The staff are all very helpful and extremely courteous. The head concierge is one of the best I have ever experienced giving great recommendations and advise. I would recommend this hotel to any business or leisure traveler.,
Top class hotel and experience,"I had an exceptional experience here during a trip to Lausanne. Right from when I arrived at the hotel I was pampered and cared for to a level beyond anything else I have received before. The room was incredible with everything being up-to-date and clean. The food, especially the breakfast, was of very high quality. This was truly a wonderful experience and well worth the money.",
Lovely Hotel,We travelled to Lausanne on February for business. We arrived very early at the hotel and the man at the front desk advised that the room was ready. The room was lovely with great views to the lake. The bar and the staff were really nice. Breakfast not as good as expected. Will repeat on next visit to La Suisse.,
Great hotel at the beautiful lake side,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. I live in Lausanne and would usually make my parents stay there if they come by. The hotel is absolutely great, deserves all the titles it has, pretty expensive but you get quality for each franc you pay. Great dining, underground parking, great view, 1 minute walk away from the beautiful lake Leman, what else do you need?)",
One of the best hotels in the world,"My third highly privileged three-night stay here amidst the royalty and the multi-millionaires. Probably the best breakfast in Europe in a beautiful, bright, sunny orangery. Restaurants excellent too, though this time I made some bad choices, and I can't blame the Beau-Rivage for that. Very, very expensive.",
Always excellent,"I had the the pleasure to spent almost one month at this hotel, while we were looking for apartment in Lausanne, so i am very familiar with this property where history and pure excellence meets and make you feel very special. The hotel is in beautifully Belle Epoche architecture and set in the middle of beautiful gardens. From the entrance to special salons and off course to your room you have to admire the decors and the perfection. Rooms are spacious and having breakfast on the balcony overlooking the Lake Geneva and French Alps is great start of the day. So is taking bubble bath in the luxury bathroom. Hotel has good gym, but the best part is the indoor and outdoor swimming pool. All 3 restaurants at the hotel are excellent it has 2 star Michellin Anna Sophia Pic, but my",
Perfect!,"Stayed for 2 nights and it was perfect! Overlooking Lake Geneva and very close to a few good local (Lausanne not Swiss) restaurants. There's a Michellin star restaurant there too but I decided to go more local with my travelling colleague/buddy. The service - impeccable. The check-in and check-out process - super speed. The room - perfection, overlooking the lake. Imagine waking up to the lake, esp. on a sunny day! The one thing is that they gave me a room with 2 combined single beds. It was very difficult to sleep in as even the comforter was split to 2. Aside from that, it was perfect! Best hotel to start my Swiss Franco experience.",
Superb in every respect,"This was my third stay at the Beau-Rivage Palace, Lausanne. Simply put, it is an absolute pleasure to stay here, if you can afford it - go. An annual trade show in Geneva brings me to the area each year on business. Geneva is a fair distance from Lausanne on the map but by the time you factor in the often-horrific downtown Geneva traffic, a jaunt up the autoroute or on the train to Lausanne makes some sense. A trip from the airport to the hotel took us just under 45 minutes outside of rush hour and just under an hour with rush hour traffic and a minor motorway crash to content with. The prices in Lausanne at show time are still very expensive but also more competitive than Geneva. This is a proper high-end hotel and pretty much everything lives up to the expectations you",
Amazing,Amazing Hotel and Restaurants. Lovely views and well worth a visit! Truly a grand European hotel with all the modern luxuries. Lunch was spectacular (order the perch it is caught locally). Gardens are lovely and everything is an easy walk. You are right on the water with amazing views of snow covered mountains.,
Worth the motorway dash from Geneva,"Geneva hotels at trade show times are generally over-priced and under-interested in you as a guest so it really is worth the short trip along the motorway - or by train - to Lausanne to stay in this confection of a hotel on the lakeside - the Beau Rivage Palace is an oasis of calm by comparison. Delightful rooms, excellent staff and prices that are not as stratospheric as in Geneva make it an ideal bolt-hole. The position at Ouchy is perfect and if you can get a lakeside room then the views, morning or evening, are just about perfect. You get a sense that the staff really do care about you no matter how busy they are and attention to detail and delivery of perfect service is something that goes to their hearts. No, it isn't cheap - whether you are buying a room, a meal or even",
A Grand Lady overlooking the Lac Leman.,"Although not particularly fond of staying in relatively big hotels, I was pleased to discover that despite the size of this hotel, and despite the many business conferences taking place and the palatial size of it all, with their impeccable service the staff here still manage to make one feel at home and very much welcomed. A small gripe about a noisy room due to some ongoing maintenance works prompted an immediate and very efficient response resulting in a flawless room change to a superior room in no time. The rooms are sumptuously furnished, the bathrooms very spacious and well equipped and the view of the mountains to die for. The whole hotel is nothing but a super luxury palace from where you never want to leave!",
Queen at the palace,"The best hotel i've ever been to. Everything was perfect. The welcoming, service, food, room, location, luxury. They made feel like a Queen at her own palace. I recommend this fine hotel to everyone who is looking to pamper themselves.",
Classic elegance,"A palace on lake Geneva. Elegant old world class. The breakfast in the atrium was amazing. The rooms exquisite. Each and every detail was to perfection. The classic architecture, the view of lake geneva and the sorounding alpes, the ambience, the details.. flowers, the serving pieces, the crystal, the linen. It lives up to its leading hotels of the world status.",
Lives up to its name,"Staying here is like staying in a Palace, very upmarket, but lives up to this.Lots of grounds to walk in and wonderfull lake views, resturants were excellent, very old world feel, but very up to date facilities, great service, and class",
One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in,"Set on the banks of Lake Geneva, the Beau-Rivage is definitely pitched upmarket with rates to match. That said, the service, rooms and general surroundings are simply fantastic. Te breakfast is served in the large semi circular conservatory extension over looking the lake and outside of Gleneagles, is just the best breakfast ever - allow a couple of hours and don't eat too heavily the night before! Clientele is a mix of rich and mega rich retirees and the odd well heeled businessman - I was booked to stay in the sister hotel next door which had closed for Christmas. If you go at Christmas, the tree in the lobby that is 4 floors high is pretty impressive.",
Most Amazing Hot Chocolate on Planet Earth,"Life changing event alert: This morning I had homemade hot chocolate at the Beau Rivage Palace hotel for breakfast. It is to hot chocolate, what Turkish coffee must be to American coffee (not that I know the first thing about coffee). It is thick, dark and universe altering. Business trips almost never result in such finds, but this one did. Truly amazing. I stayed here for an arbitration, which was held here in the hotel. The hotel is magnificent, the service is superlative and the business convenience is high. The bed was confortable and the pillows were heavenly.",
A gem on lake Geneva,"I was unsure what to expect actually. And from my arrival to a beautiful lobby filled with fresh cut flowers, to my amazing room overlooking Lake Geneva, i was blown away. actually staying there in June again. The hotel is a mixture of old and modern, but done well. Not to different, but such elegance, warmth and class. It is my new Favourite hotel in Switzerland. Beautiful restaurant for breakfast and lunch with views if italian Alps, huge hallways, and excellent rooms and meeting space. And i great location to go to Montreaux, Gryeres, Geneva or the Alps. Highly recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone.",
Beautiful Hotel on the Waterfront,"I must say, that this hotel is the Grande Dame of them all. It is beautifully situated in Lausanne along the water. There is such lush green space and plants, beautiful pool and a very good spa available with extensive services. The food is superb and there is much attention to detail. The views from the rooms are spectacular, facing Lake Geneva. It is an elegant Hotel that is quite reserved. Although it is very expensive, the ""pearl"" on the lake is the number one destination in Lausanne.",
"Unpleasant service by ""E. Marchal"" at the Lobby Lounge (terrace and inside)","The terrace of the Lobby Lounge is great thanks to its view, space and relax atmosphere. Unfortunately, all these advantages are spoiled by the attitude of a waiter called ""E. Marchal"" and his nasty and hypocrite comments towards the clients. We are frequent customers of this place (terrace and inside).",
Disappointing !!!,"It was a night in December 2012. My companion wanted to surprise me on my birthday by inviting me to my favorite restaurant! Here we are at the Beau Rivage Cafe, Lausanne or a special romantic dinner. 1st mistake: the waiter did not who ordered what, so he had to ask us ( thing that not used to happen before ......) 2nd disappointment, I always order my favorite menu there ""filet de perche"" but this time frankly , I was disappointed !!!! they were not as always , I guess there is a new chef...... 3rd and biggest disappointment for such an establishment, when we got out from the restaurant all our clothes smelled the frying !!! I couldn't believe it !!! our table was in the middle of the restaurant maybe a bit close to the kitchen, so what ? in such places this is a NO NO",
A well earned reputation for excellence,"On my way from Paris to Rome I took what turned out to be an inspired choice, to stop over in Lausanne. I was upgraded to a lake and Alps view room, and my attached image will testify to the grandeur of the view. I have stayed at a number of 5 star establishments in Europe and Asia Pacific, and this would be the best I have experience. Even though it was a one night stay, the level of service was superb. My driver and the hotel staff were still outside when I entered the lobby, and was addressed by name and greeted immediately. A nice touch. I dined in my room both for dinner and breakfast, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the meals impeccable. The old world elegance of the Beau-Rivage Palace is enhanced and you explore the many elegant ballrooms and see the",
True 5-star experience in Lausanne,"Unfortunately I spent only one night at the Beau Rivage, as I was on a business trip. Even if it was really short, I really enjoyed every minute of my stay at the Beau Rivage which is now of my best hotel experience in Europe. Pros - Overall impression : the hotel is extremely impressive even for a guy like me (I prefer contemporary and design hotels to the Grande Dame style) - Room : nothing to say, it is extremely nice and comfortable. Decoration is a bit old fashioned, and not my favorite but this is only a personal opinion. - Bulgari products in the bathroom - Jacuzzi style bathtub in addition to a separated shower cabin - Excellent quality of service (escort to the room, use of your name during every interaction, effective and friendly...). I will relate a short story that",
Lausanne's Quiet Star,"Studied, quiet elegance at any time of day or night, or weather permitting, on the exquisite terrace overlooking Lac Leman. My retreat after the death of my dear wife, I was inspired to manage grief at the very sight of a caring staff, dining room distilled in the evening light and a large suite that ignited and refreshed fading happiness. Ten days in the stunning embrace of Beau-Rivage was an altering experience and renewal of many happy times spent there several years earlier.",
Almost perfect,"We booked a suite with lake view - the later was stunning. Room was really nice, high ceiling, good mix of modern and traditional. Great in room food, good service, nice spa. If you have business in the center of lausanne you will have to take a cab or the metro",
A paradigm of late 19th Century elegance,"Located in Ouchy on the lakefront of Lac Leman in Lausanne, this hotel oozes opulence. The location is unmatched--gorgeous views of the lake and across to Evian in France, directly across the street from the lakefront providing easy access to a stroll along the waterfront and all that it has to offer, and close proximity to the Lausanne metro allowing you to travel throughout the city with ease. The staff exudes a welcoming and friendly attitude from the check-in process, which includes a personal orientation to hotel amenities and to your room, until the moment you depart. The public spaces are elegant in the extreme, with ballrooms in which you can easily imagine crowned heads of state of 19th century Europe holding court. The rooms are plushly furnished and up-to-date,",
"Geat holiday resort, grand hotel","A grand-hotel ""à l'ancienne"", old-style. It was all simply perfect. Yes, the rooms need a refreshment to move into a more modern style, but actually you don't really need that except for the pictures you will show to our friends, as all is just fantastic. Reception: we were greeted and scorted by a lovely girl who, by the time it was, went further on by asking us if we had had lunch yet. As it turned out we hadn't, a table was immediately proposed and booked at the Café Beau-Rivage, which was a nice touch. My girl received a child-size bathrobe+slippers, a bag and a welcome orange juice+cookies plate, fabulous (and delicious). Rooms: facing the lake is compulsory here, lovely view, rooms were nicely decorated on an old style but with all working and new tech. equipment,",
Amazing.,Simply amazing. Gorgeous view of the French Alps! Hotel was beautiful. Room with a view is worth it! The spa was worth spending a day in for sure. Lausanne is a beautiful town and fun to walk around. The local restaurants were all great. I would learn a some basic French before you go...we found the locals know very little English so communicating can be a challenge. :),
Our best ever hotel experience,"Excellent location, the spa/swimming pool is one of the best we have seen (in an hotel). Rooms are big, classic but not too much and have just the modernity needed, not less, not more.Then comes the restaurants...well Myako is just superb. Great service. We haven't tried Anne Sophie LePic but this must be good as well. As usual in such case...the price of the hotel and the restaurants is very high....only if you can afford it really.",
Possibly the Best Hotel in Europe !!,"Hotels such as the Gritti in Venice, the Principe in Milan and the Negresco in Nice are marvellous but what is it about the Beau Rivage Palace that makes it even more magical? Well I suppose the location is a major factor.... set on the side of Lake Leman, it is rather like a stately and elegant 'lady' proudly and majestically in position and presiding over her empire. The views from the hotel are magnificent and change with the time of day,the season and the climate. They are restful and entrancing and if one cannot stop, relax and marvel, then one has to worry for ones soul, as it makes one realise the wonder of the natural world that we live in, with the Alps as a backdrop to the beautiful lake. Our enjoyment was enhanced, as we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to the",
Our Favorite Hotel!,"We checked into the Beau-Rivage for two nights as part of our 25th Anniversary trip. We have stayed at the Beau-Rivage many times in the past for special occasions. We have used both regular rooms and various suites. Our experience is that this hotel sets the gold standard for quality, ambiance and service. If you have never been here, you need to take the time to explore the magnificent building. The breakfast room could be one of the most elegant rooms in all of Europe. The suites all look down over Lake Geneva and across the water to Evian in France with snow capped alps. The rooms are decorated to perfection with every amenity. The spa is outstanding in every aspect. The concierge and every staff member greet you by name in a way that is warm and inviting and not",
Charming Location!,"There is no substitute for the location of this Hotel! The view of the lake from our guest room was beyond compare, making closing the drapes to block morning light a challenge. The guest rooms are a bit dated, but there seems to be work being done on some guest floors. Perhaps a new look is right around the corner. While the guest experience was technically on point from a hospitality perspective, the service lacked any real warmth. I was scolded by the overnight desk agent when I did not have my key and was unsure of who would let me into my room! The words were polite, but the tone was decidedly unpleasant. Otherwise the service was officially just fine. A nice visit to a beautiful town and a grand old Hotel.",
Beautiful,"Now this is a beautiful palace and I enjoyed every moment I was there. From The décor, colours, staff, ambience, atmosphere. They live up to their promises. I cannot fault this place. I would recommend it to anyone.",
Switzerland at its FINEST,"One of the best hotels in the world . A room with a lake view is a must , It costs a little more , But it is worth it . The hotel has its own private garden . Breakfast is EXCELLENT . Outstanding service with very courteous and efficient staff.Our room was spacious and very comfortable with a lake view which is a must .

Old fashioned luxury on the shore of Lake Geneva,"My wife and I had a brief one night stay here (room 466) in September 2012. The Beau Rivage had been refurbished since my previous stay here and was looking smart and elegant. There is a lovely terrace for drinks overlooking the lake in clement weather. The room, which was the cheapest on offer, was still quite large, with a big bathroom and plenty of space to sit. The shower was good and the bed comfortable. I would have preferred a directed bedside light, but that is a minor quibble. Service was efficient and appeared genuinely friendly. A places that it is hard to dislike, until you get the bill, but this is Switzerland after all.",
Sublime,Ok so now we know how it feels to live the life of royality. You can't help be impressed. By all means don't miss dining at Sophie Pic. It's all wonderful. The spa experience was one of the best we've experienced. Faultless hospitality.,
Magical! just superb,What can i say- switzerland actually europe at its very best. Stayed here 6 years ago and thought it was amazing. This time saved up and splurged on a full lake view room- def worth it.stayed as leader club member and was upgraded to a higher category room.took my parents and they were upgraed to grand deluxe lake view room. Service amenties rooms immaculate. Staff so helpful and grounds just beautiful. Its switzerland so just accept its going to be expensive. Ate at l' accademia one night - average and unfortunately a bit of attitude from staff- its europe so just accept that.quick lunch at cafe beau rivage- perfect! Its just amazing and wpuld def be back .,
Luxury hotel with wonderful view over the Alps,"We have stayed there in August 2012 for a friend's wedding. This luxury hotel in a classic 19th/early 20th century style has all you would expect such a hotel to have: valet parking, luxurious rooms (bathroom even includes bubble bath), remarkable ballrooms for private events, fabulous pool, beautiful gardens and a breathtaking view over the Chablais part of the French Alps on the opposite side of the lake. And for parents, there even is a children playroom with live small rabbits and Guinea pigs just behind the front desk. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful and flexible. We for example ordered in-room breakfast after the deadline but the front desk still managed to take our order, even in the middle of the night. A thing you should not miss is the downstairs bar,",
Not one of the best - but it's the best !,I stayed in this hotel last jun with my family. We have booked tow connected rooms with lake view. Location is excellent. Every thing in this hotel is just so amazing . Don't go to this hotel to see Lausanne but go to Lausanne to see this hotel !,
Perfect,"We went there at the beginning of August. There is not so much to say about this hotel. The building is fantastic, the service is great, the room (with a view) is well furnished, and the spa is great also and the breakfast is just excellent.",
The beautiful place in the world!!!!!,"Very beautiful hotel on the shore of the lake. You can see Alps looking at you. Hotel is very good. As I understood it is a very old hotel. Service perfect. But when we asked for a dinner at 1 night, we couldnt find anything to eat even in the bar:)))) The nice barmen gave us tomatos and olives :)))) We had to go to our rooms and order room service. Food is very very tasty. SPA is perfect. Recommend to anyone to go there!!!",
as my nephew said: we are staying at a palace!,"Beautiful location, incredibly thoughtful staff (we had called ahead of time requesting that they purchase something for us and were delighted to see that our request had been met), large rooms with the most amazing views of the lake, incredible spa and pool. And don't get me started on their breakfast buffet -- a delicious experience. I wish we could have tried their 2 Michelin star restaurant. It shall await for another time. When in Lausanne, don't think to stop anywhere else!",
wonderful property and service at superb location,"I stayed 1 night at this hotel to attend a friends reunion in summer 2012. I was given a standard superior room with lake view in the East wing of the hotel. The hotel is wonderfully located at the shores of Lake Geneva in Lausanne Ouchy, just a quick metro ride from downtown Lausanne. The hotels is set in wonderful gardens - a very nice location! Welcome and check-in were very friendly and efficient. My room was not ready yet but the staff did accompany me to the spa area and took care of my baggage and transferred it to my room while I was enjoying the sun at the pool. My room key awaited me at the spa reception: perfect service! The room is traditionally decorated: mural paintings, belle epoch furniture and thick curtains give it a luxury atmosphere. It was perfectly clean",
One of the top hotels that I've stayed in,"This hotel, on Lake Geneva (or Lac Lemon as I learned) had stunning views both inside and out. Great location in the middle of the city. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was nicely appointed and comfortable. Loved the automatic window shades operated by a bedside remote! Great choices for dining, and one of the best breakfast buffets that I've seen. Very elegant and was a high point of our stay in this city.",
"Majestic, elegant hotel.","I have a weakness for this kind of grand, storied hotel. My wife is much less enthused about old palaces like this but even she was somewhat entranced by it's grandeur. We had a suite with very high ceilings (20 ft or so) and patio doors opening onto the lush lawn and overlooking the lake. Even the elegant bathroom had patio doors opening into another part of the grounds. This hotel is expensive but represents reasonable value in contrast to the cost of everything else in Lausanne or Switzerland in general for that matter. The breakfast buffet on the patio is very, very good. It's pretty hard to beat enjoying a delicious breakfast on a gorgeous patio overlooking the lake and mountains. Everywhere I went in this hotel I couldn't help but feel like I was spoiling and",
Over the top opulence,"Probably the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in - amazing location on Lake Geneve with beautiful views, meticulously maintained facilites and excellet, though very expensive, restaurants and bars. Only concern is of price but Lausanne is rediculously expensive in general. Staff is outstanding, rooms are beautiful and comfortable and spacious. Nice thoughtful touches at every turn.",
"Traditional elegance, beauty and modern confort","Just by the Lake, it's been there sin 1860 something. Great service, perfect ambiance and very good restaurants. It's THE place to be in Lausanne.",
A grandiose hotel,"The most impressive hotel i know . You could drive a big car in the corridors . It is majestuous , the remnant of a bygone era . The room i had was huge, with two balconies overlooking the lake . The hotel has several restaurants from three stars to a superb brasserie . The food id superb everywhere and the wine lists are endless. There are also several bars , inside and outside . And the decor is always superb and relaxing . A dream of hotel , reasonably priced if you compare with Geneva. Do not miss it. Just one remark . At breakfast , i suppose that the service is done for the most part by stagiaires from the Lausanne école d'hotellerie . Thay tend to forget what you ask them . Fortunately the professional staff is supervising .",
Wow fantastic!,Stayed here with a friend for a mommy's spa day. Staff at reception were super friendly and professional. Spa was lovely very spacious with great indoor and outdoor pool. We had 3 treatments each which were extremely relaxing. We had a lovely room facing the lake overlooking the perfectly manicured grounds. Room service menu is extensive and varied. The presentation was super and food delivery efficient. Wish we could have stayed longer!!! Will definitely go back!,
peaceful and majestic - also good for families,"As it's been mentionned many times already, Beau Rivage lausanne is a great hotel, another fine instance of swiss hospitality. We stayed with our 2 young children in connecting superior rooms facing the lake. Although those seemed to be the most basic rooms available, they were still reasonnably pleasant @32sqm plus a balcony - which I made great use of, thanks to the awesome weather. Service was always top notch which made the all experience even more pleasant, and we found it a good destination for kids as well, with the large gardens, the children playground, the couple of pools inside the hotel as well as the lake and plenty of kids friendly atractions right outside ( Yetthe crowd on Ouchy was a bit dodgy over the week end as there was a music festival there, I preferred",
Weekend Retreat,"What a delightful hotel - great food, great wine, great facilities, great staff and a great venue. We had a mid-May weekend business/leisure retreat with colleagues from across Europe. The weather on the Friday and Sunday was excellent but on Saturday, which was our working day(fortunately), it rained heavily. Our room was bright and airy with one of the quietest and yet most efficent air conditioning systems we have experienced. The staff apologised to us because we could only have a partial view of the lake - that is the bit from Lausanne to Geneva! It was more than adequate with an excellent balcony to sit out upon (sun from noon until sunset). There was also plenty of wardrobe and luggage space. The bed was very comfortable and we had two very restful sleeps. Nothing was",
"Classy, elegant, good location and feels very comfortable","It's famous place and very elegant one. It's a palace but still feels like home. There is free wifi in the rooms and everywhere in the hotel. Breakfast is very good. They have a nice terrace and pool. The hotel is facing Lac Leman. It is pretty close to the center. Metro station Ouchy is 2 min walk from the hotel. The rooms are large and well equipped. Two things I didn't like: check-in took us forever, three people changed at the reception, each one was giving different information about the waiting time (the rooms were not ready) and security deposit. We had to wait for almost two hours before our rooms were ready. The other thing is ... It's quite expensive.",
Luxurious hotel,"One of the most luxurious hotel in Lausanne (comes with the price). The service was great, especially people at the reception and the guys standing outside. We had the room facing the carpark, so i can't tell you about the wonderful views, but if you take a 5 mins walk out to Ouchy, there is a beautiful park and Lake Geneva. Two supermarkets near by as well. The breakfast (@ CHF 49) was okay, good variety.",
Lakeside luxury,"Wow! The Beau-Rivage Palace plus stunning natural setting on Lake Geneva with views to the Alps equals an unforgettable trip. We stayed in 309 - Junior Suite Beau-Rivage. The many highlights included: + Impeccable service. Breakfast staff deserve a special mention! + Bedroom / living area was very spacious, comfy bed, all mod cons + controls + Balcony - not huge, but plenty space for table and two chairs to admire those views ... + Large bathroom with huge bath / jacuzzi in the centre + Separate shower, dual sinks + luxury toiletries + Arrived to flowers, champagne and fruit - another nice touch to make you feel welcome + Classical style without feeling too stuffy or dated. Some really beautiful rooms for conferences and events on the ground floor, almost made me wish I was",
3 Nights at one of the best hotels in the world.,"Stayed on business as guests of a car manufacturer while attending the Geneva Motor Show. Nights of 4th, 5th, 6th March 2012. Drove there from the UK. This is a truly top class hotel with impeccable standards. Noithing is too much trouble to any of the staff. We were there to work, so I can't tell you about the spa and things like that. I can tell you that the 40 Euro breakfast spread is the finest I have ever seen. had some splendid scallops for dinner in one of the restaurants. The 'house red' in the bar was a fine St Emilion. Steaks, not so perfect.",
EXCEPTIONAL PALACE WHICH TRULY DESERVES ITS 5 STARS AND LEADING HOTEL OF THE WORLD RATING,"My wife and our 6 years old kid spent 2 nights in Beau-Rivage Palace from 30.03.2012 - 01.04.2012. Thanks to the great help and assistance of Mrs Hemmeler (Public relations and communications Manager), we were lucky enough to be upgraded in the Junior Suite number 209 on 2nd floor, with full lake view and balcony. This Junior Suite was just great and beautiful, especially the bathroom with a huge bath with jaccuzzi. The outside view was just breathtaking, lake Léman and mountains, just in front of you ! Upon arrival, the bell man came immediately, took our bags and was in charge of our car in a very efficient way. There was no queue at the reception and a visit of the Palace was organised for us by the excellent, professional and smiling Mrs Vanessa-Nadège Ducoloné, whom gave",
top quality,"everything in this hotel is top quality and extremely charmant. The position: looking the lake and the alps, the liberty style, and a kind of magic atmosphere. Rooms are very well equiped, with a lot of space of very good bath accessories. Bar, breakfast and restaurant are top quality both for service and food. One of best room services I experienced both speed and quality. The concierge is supporting to organize all what possible in and out the town. There is an excellent spa (even if 4 letters to confirm a massage are a bit too many....specially when they are addressed to ""monsieur Cristina""..??!!)) and I recommend the taoist massage.",
A well deserved No 1 spot,"Though living in the Lausanne area, I organised a little surprise for my wife, for our wedding anniversary and booked a room and a massage for her at the Beau-Rivage. It ended up being a lousy idea, as now, she'd love to spend a week every year at this beautiful property ! Excellent service, a view to die, most friendly and efficient service, a lovely spa, a buffet breakfast which was more than a great meal. My only little remark on the negative side: internet wifi access should not be a paying proposition. Will we be back ? Definitively !",
"Amazing place- beautiful spot, excellent service and old world charm.","We stayed at the Beau-Rivage Palace a few years ago, but when the hotel popped up on my Trip Advisor List, I just had to contribute a review. We have stayed all over, far and wide, and in all types of places (from ""super high-end"" to a ""hammock on beach"" ;-) and this place still stays in my mind as one of the most special. It is absolutely amazing location-wise, service-wise, amenities-wise..basically everything-wise. We went to Switzerland as guests of the Tourism Board, and they clearly consider this hotel to be the best Lausanne offers- and we agree 100%. The hotel itself has an old world elegance and charm. The grounds and views are magnificent. Impeccable service (and really, nice, kind people too). We had a huge room facing the lake - with huge windows that you",
Deserves it's Number One status,"I admit I have stayed here now for four years at the time of the Geneva Motor Show but here is a good reason for that! It is a fantastic place to stay and entertain business guests. The location alongside the lake is stunning. The staff are always excellent, friendly, efficient and helpful. The food and beverage service in every outlet I have tried is of excellent quality and the rooms are just so good you don't want to leave them. I have never had anything other than praise from the guests we host here and whilst no-one could describe the Beau Rivage Palace as cheap, the hotel represents excellent value when you consider just what you get for the money. And at show time the attention we receive is better than anything I have ever experienced at the Geneva hotels who really know",
Great Service and very friendly Staff,"Stayed at this hotel for one night and have been upgraded into a great lake view room. Staff was great, very helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and very clean, loved the amenities and the view. Breakfast is definitely worth paying for. Incredible service and a large choice of dishes, with an amazing view on lake Geneva. I was expecting a lot from the SPA but was not amazed. Very standard for a 5 star Palace Hotel nothing crazy, although the service was here, again, just perfect!",
I advise everyone.,"Vacation in May. An excellent, respectable hotel on the shores of Lake Geneva, is located in the heart. A cozy lounge with a small fountain, where you can drink coffee and admire the beautiful sky (glass ceiling). The rooms are spacious, the furniture, though, in the Baroque style, such a antiques. The restaurant plays the piano a wonderful woman who knows a couple of Russian songs (""Dark Eyes"" in English ""longitudinal road ...""). Food is very good, but the range of low-key. Service without flaws. I advise everyone.",
Great experience,"I stayed at the Beau-Rivage Palace for one night and was truly amazed by the impeccable service - friendly, quick and just perfect! Honestly, every request and wish was answered with a yes and the solution was provided immediately. Also, the spa is beautiful and everyone is genuinely friendly there too. My special thanks go to Annalia, who is a true hair artist - I can really recommend her warmly! All in all, my short stay was all I could ask for - I totally enjoyed myself! So if you are looking for a luxurious hotel with wonderful service, the Beau-Rivage Palace is the place for you in Lausanne.",
Lovely,"Great hotel in a lovely surrounding. We were kindly offered to check in late in order to fully enjoy the spa, which was very much appreciated! Morning breakfast was lovely, overlooking the mountains and had a wide array of healthy choices. Would love to go back in summer as the outdoor area also seemed very charming!",
perfect setting,Lake view room provided wonderful vistas- As we were there in late summer sitting on the veranda with an aperitif was a cosmic experience. We fully enjoyed their breakfast service and the manager was a perfectionist. I also was surprised that the front desk receptionist escorted us and introduced us to our room personally. This was a Mercedes euro delivery trip and when the valet brought up our car at check out he presented us with a travel bag with 2 cold fresh bottled waters - quite a nice touch. Felt like royalty,
a true five star experience !,"we spent a real great week end celebrating a friend's birthday . this is a real palace with the service and staff that you would expect . the spa area is perfect , breakfast is good and if not on display on the buffet you can order pretty much anything you'd like . we just had a small issue with the housekeeping late at night (12pm) for a quilt and pillow change , they had to come 5 times and it took almost an hour to get it done properly , all this would have been ok if this was not requested few hours earlier ... but i must admit they were very appologetic and we had a nice present from the management to soothe the pain . we would be happy to go back anytime . during our stay we had dinner at the anne sophie pic michelin star restaurant and we were very desappointed , we",
Like stepping into another world...,"We stopped here on the first leg of a driving trip through southern Europe, and could not have a picked a more appropriate place to re-acclimate to a vacation mind-set. The hotel is meticulously maintained and clean, by our estimation, and really takes you back to a more elegant time and place, without compromising comfort. Imagine the sort of classic elegance that some modern hotels are trying to achieve, this is the template. Granted, you have to switch off the part of your brain that is counting every dollar, euro, and franc you are spending to enjoy yourself here. This is, for most of us, a splurge. But to go through your visit here looking at every bill would ruin the experience. So figure out all that ahead of time so once you pull into the port cochere you can",
You would not want it any other way,"The hotel is the best in its class - Belle Epoch hotel. The hotel has plenty of character of the old grand luxury. It balances it well with modern comforts, though on its own terms. Original features are preserved with care like old revolving doors that originated not far from here. The hotel allows you to travel back in time and this means letting go of some of the modern comfort. If you are staying here during the cold months you have to turn the heater on in the bathroom a few minutes before going in otherwise it is too cold. At the restaurant during breakfast you might want to wear a warmer jacket on a cold morning unlike at modern hotels with perfectly controlled constant temperature all year round. But interestingly so this things add to the experience rather then",
"Very nice hotel and restaurant, but poor customer care","The hotel is great and the restaurant is also outstanding, but the customer care is awful. We have organised several business lunches and full day meeting sessions in their restaurant, everything was fine except that despite the price paid they ask you to pay in addition the parking fee for the guests/participants outside at their parking gate at a automated cashier. It is just a pity to handle customers with such low care after an expensive lunch or meeting working day. Same low customer care applies when you spend time in their SPA for expensive treatments, you are still asked to pay an expensive extra to be able to use the swimming pool and you have also to pays their private parking fee. For such a good and expensive hotel/restaurant/spa, it is just a poor customer care.",
Exceeded my Expectation,"This is by far the best hotel around here, and on of the best in Europe. I am a frequent business traveller, i have highest membership status in several airlines and hotels, so its hard to exceed my expectation when it comes to hotels, but this hotel did exceeded my expectations.",
Beautiful but far from perfect,My husband and I spent three nights here during a 30 day trip to Europe. First the good. The location is wonderful. We had a ocean view suite with a balcony. It is easy to walk everywhere from here and the ferry is a close walk too. We checked in early and our room wasn't ready. They graciously provided a glass of champagne and arranged lunch by the pool. There is where the shock began. $200 for a poor club sandwich and small salad with 2 glasses of wine? Crazy! There were some serious other flaws. The first night we awoke at 4 am to a high pitch alarm sound. First thing in the morning we asked for a manager at the front desk. They said they would look into it. When the maid came to clean she couldn't believe the sound and was very apologetic. After returning to,
Five stars is not enough!,"We stayed at the B-R in September for two nights. On our way from Paris to Italy by train we wanted to spend a day in Lausanne to see the lake, etc. At the time of booking the only place with vacancies was th B-R, although the cost was way above what we wanted to spend in the end it was a case of ""well why not spoil ourselves"". I'm glad we did this as the experience was spectacular. On arrival you have to be impressed by the granduer of the place, but the treatment by staff is not pretentious, it is personal and helpful ... it was just great. An upgrade to a lake view room was a pleasant surprise and I have to say it is the best accommodation I have ever stayed in. Bit like a balcony room at the Palace of Versailles, except with better view!! Opulent is the word that describes",
Perfect place to relax on vacation,"It is rare for me to give 5 ratings for a hotel, especially one that costs me so much, but I was hugely impressed with this hotel. From the time I arrived to the time I left I was mostly greeted by name and always with the perfect balance of just right service without being too pushy or too absent. I was staying in a lake view room on the 4th floor and this was very nice. The only issue was a connecting door which I usually specify not to have but forgot on this occasion. I liked the roon so thought I would try it out. There was some noise from next door the first night but not enough for me to want to repack and move. As you can see fropmn my rating it didn't influence my opinion of the hotel, but if you don't like connecting rooms, remember to specify that. In",
Expectations Surpassed,"We had been told that the Beau-Rivage was the best place to stay in the Lausanne/Geneva area. For us as tourists, it certainly was. The low-key Lausanne environment was very relaxing, centrally located with easy access to Geneva, Montreaux, etc. The B-V was exceptional in every aspect. The room was wonderful (lake view w/ balcony). Haven't had a better stay in Europe.",
One of the Best,"This hotel is one of the best we have stayed in on all counts.. Location, service, size of room, quality of beds, fantastic pool/spa, and wonderful food. I only wish we could have stayed longer. Do try the fantastic Italian restaurant next door in the sister hotel Angleterre. It is superb and a great view. ",
"Fantastic hotel
Great views and beautiful decoration","Superb service, great rooms Love to come back every year!",
A great hotel with exemplary response to feedback,"I expected this hotel to be very good, and it was. It has modernised skilfully and is a great mix of updated facilities with traditional luxury. Pretty much everything lived up to billing: excellent rooms, really good housekeeping, charming service at every level - and a lovely terrace to sit out on and enjoy the view of the lake. The staff were relatively young and informal for a 'grand' hotel with the odd mistake or omission, but all cheerfully put right. But what impressed me most was the speedy response to any problem, and the fast/positive response to feedback in person on questionnaires. The attitude is the old one that the customer is right, and it's a welcome change from some of the poor responses at similar establishments or lesser ones. The only problem with the",
Excellent service and beautiful setting,"This is a wonderful for hotel -- the staff is friendly and accomodating. When booking it is best to ask for an inclusive package with breakfast since you can order it in your room as well. Otherwise, ala carte or the buffet is quite steep. For proximity to Lac Leman and downtown via Metro, it is really quite convenient. It is expensive; however, booking a room facing the city can get you a better deal. The bar and lounge on the ground level is very relaxed and has live music.",
Best Hotel in Lausanne,"This place is tops. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with the best of Swiss hospitality and responsiveness. The hotel located right on Lake Lausanne (more like a resort) is grand and is in tip-top shape - not an insignificant task given its size. We had a lake view room, which was comparable to any Four Seasons hotel...very large, luxurious, clean, and with every amenity one might expect from a hotel of this caliber. The room was whisper quiet and the beds extremely comfortable. The numerous hotel restaurants were all wonderful and best of all, they all had the best views of the lake in the city. The extensive gardens are filled with flowers and are well manicured. The pools were great for both relaxing and swimming laps. My wife really enjoyed the gym and",
Grand Hotel Tired,"At first blush this five star grand hotel is spectacular in the tradition of years gone by. The lobby, the function rooms and all public rooms are very grand. We had a junior suite overlooking the lake with a balcony. It was very large, spacious and comfortable. The room facilities were more than adequate. However, we found the soft furnishings old and the room looking generally tired and in need of refurbishment from bedspread to carpets to curtains. The shower stall in the bathroom leaked because the shower head was unstable. All fittings and furnishings have remained untouched for many years. The service particularly left much to be desired. Staff were young and inexperienced in the main dining room serving breakfast with no management in sight. Requests were unfulfilled or",
A palatial home by the lake ...,"We chose to stay at Beau-Rivage Palace as it was in the Amex Fine Hotels list and also because of its location. Deservedly, it has been called the best hotel in Lausanne and is also the current no 1 hotel on the Trip Advisor list. The location, in Ouchy by the lakeside, is unbeatable. You can easily explore Ouchy by walking, or the rest of Lausanne by taking the Metro, the 'Ouchy' stop of which is only 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel. You can wander down to the waterfront in a few minutes and take the ferry across the lake to Evian, if you so wish. But you may also want to spend some time and enjoy the luxuries of the hotel which has a wonderfully large ground that you can explore (there is even a small pet dog cemeteries in one corner of the ground, where Coco",
"Good, but NOT world class...","Stayed here for 2 weeks on business. A very good hotel in a wonderful location. BUT... Clearly used to catering to uber wealthy as evidenced by the occasional arrogance/condescending attitude of hotel staff. Specific examples: after eating in formal/stuffy/expensive restaurants on business all week, I wanted a relaxed, informal meal. When I advised the Concierge that I would love a place with good Moules and Frites or a burger, his response was to look at me with disdain and respond ""but that is not good food..."" Very telling.",
Back to Beau Rivage,"This was our third consecutive time we went to the Beau Rivage Palace in Lausanne. We were lucky in the weather and the room.The view over the lake was fantastic. The service is still at top level and the concierge helped a lot with some tips regarding a journey in the vineyards of Lavaux. The breakfast in the terrase rounded by small birds is something we don't forget. Two remarks: 1) The Marie Sophie Pic Restaurante has an excellent food and service, but we don't like to have in places like this people wearing jeans and tee-shirt without manners. A dress code shoul be recomended. 2) The furniture of the room was poor for this hotel standard.",
"keep coming back, love this place","The Beau Rivage Palace in Lausanne is one if these must visit hotels. I have been there several times in the last several years and the place continues to keep its great level of hosting and style. If you are looking for a chain hotel, don’t waste your time, this is a real palace. The rooms overlooking the lake are amazing, spacious and the bathroom is a real treat. The breakfast overlooking the lake, you wish will never end. The team is there to make your visit the best. The swimming pool is good and the adjacent fitness and spa a great plus, if you want to jog in the morning, there is a nice path on the lake. The Olympic museum is next door and worth visiting and there is a tram close by that you can get downtown and to other restaurants, there are a lot of small places",
Great Hotel,"Stayed here on business for 4 nights. This is a great hotel - wonderful food and fantastic staff. Rooms are spacious and comfortable - the bed in particular was a dream to sleep in. Weather was very good when I was there and so we had the advantage of being able to sit out on the terrace and take in the wonderful views. The Beau Rivage is an expensive place and if I was to come back again for a personal holiday, it would need to be for a very special occasion!",
One of the Top Hotels in the World,"The Beau-Rivage is one of the top hotels in the world. Its location on Lake Geneva and grounds are beautiful. The rooms are extremely elegant and the service is surpurb. I visited the Beau-Rivage on business, but I see it as the ideal hotel to visit on a vacation. It is very expensive, but for a special trip or meeting, it is worth it.",
"Comfort, luxe and great facilities","The hotel has a good location with a wonderful view on the lake. 2 minutes from the metro which gets you in city center in 5 minutes. The staff is very nice and helpful. There are great facilities with a spa, an indoor and an outdoor swimming pool, a beautiful terrace and several restaurants and bars. The rooms are comfortable with a big bathroom. The only little comment would be about the bed which could be a bit more comfortable.",
Great stay...will be back,"I stayed here last year on a business trip and it was a shame I wasn't here for pleasure. The room was beautifully decorated and the views of the lake and the mountains were magnificant. There were a few restaurants at the hotel, but I only at one and thought it was incredible. If I ever go back to Switzerland, I would definately stay here again.",
WOW! Great hotel - Loved it!,"Stayed here for 4 nights! Could not find one complaint with the hotel. Huge room (for european standards), Jacuzzi in the room - Very Relaxing. Hermes Toiletries, Loved the lighting in the room (Most business Hotels rooms are not lighted up enough, but here i had to turn the lights down. Very Comfortable beds, seamless check in. Parking onsite. Huge Hotel, Beautiful Decor. Loved it!",
Great Hotel,Extremly high standard of service with a great attention to all those details that make the difference. Unfortunately was not able to make the most of the SPA which did look also top class.,
Lacked atmosphere but very high quality,"I cannot disagree with the other reviewers regarding the quality of the Beau Rivage palace - but to me it lacked an atmoshphere. The rooms are very spread out, it*s a long walk to reception from anywhere. The bar area was very dull. I'm sure if you were a couple or a famous person wanting not to be disturbed this is right up your street but the more atmoshperic Chateau Douchy would be my choice everythime in Lausanne.",
Captures the pleasure of a long-forgotten leisure era,"It is curious that as I travel around the business world in a whirlwind of meetings, “fat-boy” suppers and early rises ... I never get a chance to stop and smell the roses. Enjoying the Beau Rivage Palace hotel vicariously through my wife was a new and wonderful experience. To make a list of “WOW” things we noted might be seen as crude and vulgar I know but I feel that the superbly expedited little things made this hotel exceptional and different; The charm and elegance of all the staff was stunning Breakfast “wheeled in” – a pleasure from a leisure era Beautiful flowers everywhere and with everything The team at the concierge desk knowing ones room number unprompted The personability of the staff in the restaurants If the above doesn’t resonate, then maybe you as a consumer",

My favorite,"For sentimental reasons, me and Ana we have decided in 2009, to spent a weekend every year at the Beau-Rivage in Lausanne. In June 2009 we have stayed for 3 nights in a room with a view to the lake. The room was fantastic with is little balcony and is panoramic view over the lake. We have had a wonderful experience at Marie Sophie Pic Restaurant. In Last year in September we repeated the visit. This time the room was excellent but only with a partial view of the lake. we appreciated the improvements on the breakfast (food and the decoration). at the Beau Rivage you can count on a excellent service and in the rooms there are everything to make your stay pleasant.",
"Expensive, but worth it...","We stayed many times there: always a delight... Outstanding service, fantastic views on the Lake and the Alps. Food delicious, breakfast included (always a good sign...) Rooms slightly out of date, but the main floor has been redone in a modern clean style (look at the bar...). OK, expensive... but at least delivers the value. Definitely worth it...",
an oasis of wonderful,"After a couple of borderline hotels on this trip, the Beau-Rivage is an oasis of wonderful. I'm praying for a blizzard, so I can get trapped here for just one more day. It's a well crafted balance of old-world architectural ornament and subtle style updates. There are two bars, one right off the lobby, and one buried in a lower-floor wing. In the lobby bar, there's a beautiful side-room flanked by glass wine-case walls. The downstairs bar is more cosy/intimate in scale. The rooms are generously sized, with a full shower and tub. Bulgari branded soap? Whew knew Bulgari made soap? Swank. My sister is now getting Bulgari soap for Christmas. And free internet? My cup runneth over. Really, the hotel website is accurate. It's beautiful and gracious. You can't go wrong here.",
Magnificent Hotel,This is an amazing hotel in a beautiful city. The service is top notch and efficient. The Swiss know how to do it right. Beautiful rooms with every accommodation you could ever want. Very expensive but really worth the money. The hotel restaurant was nice but not our favorite on our trip and the big brunch didn't really seem worth the money. Beautiful spa and Teens loved the pool. It was a beautiful snowy visit at Thanksgiving. Don't miss the Olympic museum and a trip to the old city.,
A Truly Majestic Hotel,"Previous comments say it all. This hotel has a wonderful air of understated elegance in every way. The friendly, courteous and seriously efficient staff in no small way contribute to this atmosphere which indicates a very high level of strong leadership at the top. It is clearly evident that morale among the staff is of a very high order. For those who consider themselves to be 'financially challenged' when making a booking, my advice would be to have a quiet word in the ear of your bank manager to persuade him that this is a 'once in a lifetime experience'.",
worth the money you spend,Wat a great hotel.My friend and I realy enjoyed our time there. The staff was exteremly nice and respectful. They made our stay memorable.,
"Luxurious, excellent service, great hotel","It is really a palace in front of the lake. The hotel itself is very spacious and luxurious. The rooms, at least the one I got, was not that spacious, but was not tiny either, unlike the bathroom wich was nice and big, perhaps except for the shower, and it had very nice amenities. The service is really excellent, room service is top quality, breakfasts (room service) were delicious and always on time. The staff were very very nice also. One thing I would improve, is the air conditioning as, at least in my room, was non existing. Bear in mind that it is located in a very quiet area (even for Lausanne standards), away from any shopping possibility given that shops close around 6 pm. But given the nice hotel, you solve this minor issue by taking a bus, metro or cab uptown.",
Another Great Stay,"Once again we have had a great stay at the Beau Rivage Palace. This time around we were fortunate enough to get an upgrade to a lakefront corner room junior suite complete with balcony and the usual spectacular views of Lac Leman. The staff, as in the past, were all friendly, extremely helpful and just couldn't do enough. Room housekeeping and furnishings excellent; bathroom huge with a separate tub and stand-along shower..marble everywhere; double sinks and french doors that fully opened. The room itself had three closets including a walk-in with all sorts of amenities; free internet access using the large screen TV. Very comfortable bed..overall the consistency we've come to expect from this establishment which has yet to disappoint. Some have said the ""gilded age is",
Simply Beautiful,"This hotel is beautiful, the location is perfect, the service is amazing, and their breakfast is wonderful. The staff was more than happy to help us with our train tickets. Our room was clean and luxurious. We had a fantastic stay.",
Wonderful Service and Beautiful View,The service is wonderful and the views are outstanding. I truly enjoyed my stay.,
Can't beat the view,"A grand old hotel in one of the most beautiful places in Europe. It was wonderful to wake up each morning to views of the lake and mountains. Perfect location, you can walk anywhere. Service was good -- we especially enjoyed sitting on the terrace each night. However, for a 5 star hotel, I couldn't believe how shabby the furnishings in my room were. The furniture/bedspread/drapes were overly worn and appeared to be vintage 1970. I was very suprised because the room furnishings didn't seem to fit in with the overall high quality vibe of the hotel. It wouldn't prevent me from staying here again, but I would certainly advise others to check out your room first.",
One of the best Hotels in the World,"Due to how good the Hotel and it's staff were, for the first time I feel compelled to write a brief review. We have stayed in some of the best Hotels throughout Europe, Ritz Paris, Dorchester London etc and quite simply this is the best Hotel ! Beautiful Hotel, excellent service, friendly staff , wonderful pool and spa, great location, and amazing food in various bars and restaurants. Quite simply a wonderful stay, thankyou . We found it by chance, and apart from writing this review won't be telling many people as it is a real hidden Gem ;)",
"A lovely, luxurious hotel..breathtaking views","This hotel is simply a luxury...with its proximity to city center, metro and breathtaking views of the lake, my stay was quite an experience. From the point of check-in, through room service requests, quality of stay, and final check out, everything was perfect. With the design & architecture of the rooms, and the building itself, it has a very grand feel, and there simply is no substitute for those views of the lake and mountains, especially on a clear day. A must to say here, at least once.",
Simply the best hotel,"• Prior to arrival: I found a deal on the myswitzerland.com website and booked there. When I emailed the hotel to ask for an extra bed on the room, I got a quick response as well as a request for our child’s name and a promise for a surprise gift. • Check-in and check-out: Check-in was fantastic! We were invited to complimentary welcome champagne and snacks on the terrace which overlooks Lake Geneva and the Alps. We were then shown to our room by one of the hosts who explained all the features of the room, including the plug converter and umbrella. We were also given the Lausanne metro passes for the duration of our stay. • Stay: The room was spacious and elegantly decorated. Both the bedroom and bathroom has balcony with remote-controlled awning. The bedroom",
"The ""Guilded Age"" is Over at This Hotel, and That's a Shame","If you've never stayed in hotel like this you simply must, at least once. Grand hotels such as this one built in a bygone era, to serve a bygone clientele who lived a forgotten life of opulence and grandeur. Hotels such as this dot the great cities of Europe. Many in the smaller towns that never grew up (such as Lausanne) were simply lost. This one was rescued and lovingly restored to perfection by the Sandoz pharmaceutical family. We stayed for less than a week in their Imperial Suite, the best in the hotel. It was truly beautiful. Antique furniture felt as comfortable as modern. The walls lined with silk and gold. Gold faucets, ornate marble, carved plaster and 16 foot ceilings throughout. Wonderful honey colored wood floors and rich carpets. The curtains were thick and",
Gorgeous olde-worlde palace with every modern facility,"The Beau-Rivage Palace enjoys a most-enviable location, just off Lac Leman in Ouchy, Lausanne. You can see clear across to Evian in France on a good day, and the lake always looks lovely. Within the hotel, the rooms are luxe, but in a way that does not intimidate. The staff is very courteous, and the directrice is wonderful and knows a lot of Hindi. Interesting, one of the restaurants has a separate vegetarian menu. If your pockets can stand it, the hotel also has a Michelin-starred restaurant, Anne Sophie Pic. We visited the spa and immediately wished we had packed our swimsuits -- the pool is really enticing. The hotel's location is very convenient for walks along the promenade, the Olympic Museum and the Ouchy metro station (the metro is the most convenient way to get across",
"Great hotel, great location, great staff....",I was lucky enough to visit the hotel twice in April and I was so impressed. The hotel has a great location with some rooms overlooking the lake of geneva which is one of the most awesome sights ever. The second time I got a room on the other side looking over their gardens but this was great as well. The lobby is rather small but it makes the hotel more intimate. The rooms are fantastic - huge by Swiss standards and very very comfortable.The bathrooms and the amenities from Bulgari are to be mentioned. Every bathroom has a jacuzzi and a shower stand. The food in the restaurant is amazing as is the Spa. Overall a fantatsic experience.,
"heaven, I'm in heaven....","okay, this is for the male readers only: if you really really want to surprise/impress your girlfriend, partner, wife or whatever – this is the place to go! The only other place comparable in Europe is Villa D’este in Como We were invited to a wedding in September 2009 which took place at the Beau Rivage. The prize for a room makes you swallow – but it is worth every dime! Even tho we got a super dooper rate (related to the wedding) I asked at the front desk if they might have a room with a lake view. And horary – we got one! Sometimes you just have to ask nicely! The staff is amazing and tries everything possible. You get there and from the minute you walk in you feel like Alice in Wonderland. Everybody is super nice and friendly but still “human”, the architecture is mind",
Excellent Staff,"Well, I did spring for one of the better rooms with a nice lake view, but overall i found the attitude and attention to detail by the staff to be first rate. A bit disappointed in the difficulty of finding real Swiss food in the neighborhood.",
Grand Hotel on a Beautiful Lake,This is a beautiful hotel on Lake Geneva. I spent 4 days here with my family over Easter. Two days were nice and sunny and I spent a lot of time on the balcony soaking in the lake view. I had a wonderful experience in the Cinq Mondes spa onsite. The services are expensive but worth it in my opinion. Beau Rivage is close to the metro stop which takes 5 minutes to get to the city center. We went into the city for sightseeing and shopping on the non sunny day. Overall the staff is very friendly and accomodating and I will stay again.,
Grand hotel but too many flaws,"Beautiful and expensive lakefront hotel with just as grand of an interior. The rooms that have a “park view” actually look over the parking lot/hotel car entrance. The superior rooms are about the same size but (a lot) more expensive because of the view. Decoration is very classic/old style except for the bathroom, which is supposed to look like marble but is basically made of hard plastic tiles. Jacuzzi and Bulgary amenities, however, are a plus. The spa area is beautiful and they claim having spent more than 10 million USD putting it together. What they do not tell you, however, is that although it might be reasonably sized if it was only to serve guests of the Beau Rivage, it seems to be widely used by locals, who probably pay only a (small) fraction of what you pay for a",
Best hotel in Lausanne,This is an incredible property. The interior spaces are a stunning mix of classical and modern design. This hotel has old world charm but isn't the old and stuffy wealthy geriatric refuge that you might expect given it's history and location. I was pleasantly surprised and would rank this among the best properties that I have visited anywhere. Best things about the property: - the architecture - tastefully executed mix of modern and classic design elements - impeccable service (professional but very friendly) - spacious rooms with lovely views and balconies - large bathrooms with towel warmers - excellent food and beverage outlets - free in-room internet I can't think of anything that isn't good about this property. I also thought it ended up being good value for the,
Complete Luxury by the Lake,"This hotel was absolutely brilliant. The staff could not do enough to help us on arrival and throughout our stay. The hotel spa facilities had everything you need and nice and quiet to help you relax. The views across the lake were fantastic. Our Hotel room was fantastic and very spacious. The Cafe Beau Rivage was very expensive (although most places were this was even more so) but the food quality was great and service was good too. I would recommend the Academia restaurant at the Hotel next door too, slightly cheaper but just as nice. The town was easy to access using the Metro (too steep to walk up) which the hotel gave us complimentary tickets for and enjoy a stroll back down the hill to take in the views.",
"Fantastic, First Class and Perfect!","We went for our wedding anniversary to Beau Rivage for 3 days. The hotel location is just perfect with stunning views of the Evian Mountain and the lake. We wokeup every morning to a stunning view and delicious breakfast! The hotel is short walk to the lake and you can take a boat to visit Evian or take the train to visit Geneva 30minutes away. The swimming pool located on the lake side, so still you are exposed to nature and the most beautiful view of Evian. Its not my first time to Lausanne and its not my first time in this stunning hotel, i would never choose to stay anywhere else!",
Simply stunning!,"This is the quintessential Grand Hotel - it's simply stunning, with one of the most beautiful terraces I've ever sat on - overlooking Lake Geneva with fantastic views over to Evian and the mountains beyond. The rooms are spotless, comfortable and most seem to have a balcony where you can sit and marvel at the gorgeous views. There are three great restaurants - the Michelin starred Sophie Pic, a great little Japanese place and a very comfortable cafe bistro as well as two great bars. But most of all the service everywhere in this hotel is simply outstanding. From the moment you arrive at the front desk, to the concierge, and the staff in the bars and the restaurants - it's all faultless. Everyone is incredibly polite in that wonderful formal Swiss way and nothing is too much",
Great Stay,"Unlike some of the reviewers who had ""plastic"" bathrooms, we stayed in the retty much lowest level ""comfort room"" (no lake view) and enjoyed it thoroughly. Our bathroom was marble, marble everywhere and was of great size with two sinks, wonderful water pressure, a full shower curtain, and it even had a balcony. Room measured 16 X 23 and had plenty of closet space, furnishings were in good repair, and the housekeeping was excellent. Hotel staff were very helpful, friendly, etc. Enjoyed the indoor/outdoor pool and the large hot tub next to the pool. Easy walk to the lakefront and to the Metro from the hotel. Great weekend stay and will certainly return.",
fabulous service,"I had great expectations on this stay at Beau rivage..and Beau Rivage overcame them all ! the rooms are kind of small and not exactly my taste,but this hotel has the best concierge I ever had to deal with !! I went through a situation that I needed aditional help from both concierge and doorman..and both did above expected ,and made me feel they did it with pleasure !! Great food with fair price for the quality .. beautiful grounds ,stunning pool..AND ABOVE ALL EXTRAORDINARY STAFF!",
Extremely disappointing,"Having heard so many amazing things about this hotel, (and having fallen in love with the pictures on its web site) I actually made a stay at the Beau Rivage Palace a ""requirement"" when planning a four-week holiday in Europe. We stayed at a staggering selection of luxury hotels in every city including the Gritti Palace (Venice), Four Seasons Firenze, Claridges, Hassler, Le Bristol (Paris) and George V (Paris)and several other unbelievably great hotels, as we always do. For years, however, due to its reputation, trip advisor reviews and photos...staying here has always been a goal. I stayed at the Hotel des Bergues (Four Seasons in Geneva) last year and it was outstanding..but I still had this nagging feeling of regret that I did not stay here instead. In order to put my dream",
This hotel is very special,"I stayed here for the first time for three nights in August 2009. I have to say that I was a little apprehensive that the style might be a bit too snooty, but it was anything but ! The public rooms of the hotel are magnificent but somehow this is not in the least off-putting. In fact, the hotel was one of the most relaxing places we stayed in a three week trip. All the staff - from the bar staff to the very helpful concierge who got me an emergency dental appointment at very short notice - were very friendly and charming. The bedroom was huge with gorgeous views over Lake Leman and the French Alps on the far side. It was exceptionally comfortable and quiet. The facilities at the hotel are perfect - there is a very smart Ann Sophie Pic gourmet restaurant but you can also eat",
Fabulous Experience ! ! !,"Fantastic Hotel, in all respects. Great food, ambience, views, staff, rooms, you name it. Makes you feel like a King!!!! Truely a Palace worth staying in. The view of the lake from the rooms is simply breadthtaking. Dont miss staying at this Hotel for anything in the World (if it fits in your budget). It beats the Marriotts, Four Seasons, Ritz, Inter Continental, you name it. One of my finest experiences ever !!!!",
One of the world's best hotels,"A great setting, I advise getting a lakeview room. Dine at the outdoor Beau-Rivage patio. They made the kids whatever they wanted. Very high quality food. Walk along the lake pathway or metro (simi-subway) up the hill to town. Great pools and healthclub. Friendly roomservice. Simply one of the best places in the world for older kids and parents. Plenty for everyone to do. Without kids it would remain one of the best hotels in the world.",
Perfect,"I first stayed in this hotel in 2006 and thus expected a great experience. If anything this stay was better than the first save for the fact we had only two days to wake up to that beautiful lake view. The main dinning room has wonder food, great service and is a near perfect place for a romantic dinner.",
A true Grand Hotel with (good) soul,"This is the kind of hotel I seek in my travels, but so rarely find. It breathes history, yet is renovated tastefully modern. It hosts extensive public areas (lobby, bar, terrace, pool), yet it retains an intimate touch. There is a fantastic view, yet you are right downtown. There is only one downside: the training level of the service staff does not correspond with the price level.",
Stunning!,"We stayed at the Beau Rivage for a week in May for a corporate event. It was slightly last minute, so I was not sure what type of place it would be. Was I EVER impressed. The hotel is spectacular. It is located beside Lake Geneva with extraordinary views of the lake. When you enter the hotel, there is a terrace in at the enterance. That terrace has a great view of the lake and the staff at the terrace are very accomodating and do everything in their power to accomodate. The rooms were large for European standards. The room came with wireless and cable internet options, iPod hook up, TV, jetted tub/shower, mini-bar, big closet and drawers, electronic blinds, desk and hair dryer. The beds were very comfortable to sleep in. The only issue that I had with the room is a minor one.",
A special place.,My husband and I recently stayed at Beau Rivage Palace for four nights in a superior room with a lake view. We almost cancelled our trip but we are very glad we didn't. It was the best hotel we have stayed at (having stayed at various other leading hotels of the world). We arrived 2 hours earlier than the check in time due to our train arrival times. We were given complimentary champagne on the terrace until our room was ready. The hotel and grounds alone are stunning. The view of Lake Geneva and the Swiss Alps from our room was magical. Staff were very helpful and not snobby at all. The swimming pool area had two heated swimming pools and a jacuzzi. We relaxed by the poolside for two days. Gym is small but sufficient to work out. Room was roomy and comfortable with a,
Pure Perfection,"Just back from 3 nights at the Beau Rivage. This luxury hotel is pure perfection. Welcomed with a smile, kind comments and friendly attitude. 3 days of complete pampering. Everything was perfect. The room, impeccable. The service, flawless. A true 5 star luxury palace. I was a little wary about the hotel being ""snobby"" after reading some other reviews on tripadvisor. Indeed in a luxury palace with rooms running 1000$ a night, the other clients were certainly wealthy individuals. I suppose the interaction you have with others depends on your own behaviour (if you are, for example, noisy brash and obnoxious I can imagine you may get a snobbish or condescending attitude as a reply). We encountered nothing but considerate, kind behaviour from the staff, with a smile",
We left feeling we hadn't stayed long enough!,"We left feeling we hadn't stayed long enough. One of those hotels where the moment the bedroom door is opened and you catch the first climpse you know everything is going to be perfect. Our room was 552 (Superior lake view) and its nice but it doesn’t rely on its Bulgari amenities, or its flat screen TVs, copious flower arrangements or fruit presentations to create a wow factor when it presents us with such a view of natural beauty. The view from the two terraced windows across the lake to the mountains above Evian is simply incredible. It epitomises romanticism and lends itself to whiling the time away on the balcony chatting (perhaps over a Roderer) watching the world go by. I would thoroughly recommend a walk along the promenade which hugs the lakeshore in front of the",
"Switzerland, Lausanne Beau-Rivage Palace: ""Absolutely amazing""","I spent Christmas with family at Beau-Rivage Palace in Lausanne. We all came from all over the world to spend Christmas together in this beautiful setting. It was long since I slept so well. I don´t know if it was the peace of the fairyland outside the window with the blueness of the glacial lake of Geneva and the almost surreal beauty of the alps behind it, or the magnificent calm atmosphere of Beau-Rivage Palace itself. The combination I presume. This luxorious hotel with its long history - well illustrated in its lovely frescoes in 18th century style - has despite its volume and variety of restaurants and bars a cosy and charming atmosphere to it. Also thanks to the sincere and pleasant staff - truly service-minded. Every morning we took a swim in the amazing spa downstairs,",
Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed at the Beau Rivage over New Year, and it rapidly became one of my favourite hotels! The hotel is old, and has a place in history - a significant European treaty having been signed there in the early 20th Century. Many grand old hotels struggle to remain up-to-date, but the Beau Rivage remains grand and yet modern. I loved it. The staff were attentive, absolutely no problems there. We were welcomed with a complimentary glass of champagne, and our luggage whisked to our room, despite having arrived earlier than the check in time. We had booked a 'comfort room' without lake view, but the room was large, grand - and the lake could just about be seen through the windows. I am sure the lake view rooms are amazing, although we were more than happy with the standard of",
Perfect X-mas!,"Wonderful scenery, beautiful hotel & excellent service!",
Biggest Disappointment,"We stayed at this hotel as part of package that included six ""Regal"" hotels of Europe. The only things we found ""regal"" was the look of the hotel (beautiful!) and the attitude of the staff (horrible). Snooty does not begin to describle the attitude. And no matter what NEVER ask one person to do ANYTHING but there own job. They either are not allowed or just do not want to answer. As an example do not ask the front desk person how to get to the boat dock. They will tell you that ""only"" the concerige can answer that. Rooms are nice but small. Prices are NOT small for anything. THe hotel attracts a lot of rich jerks. The couple next to us actually raised their voice because the ""The mint leaves in our tea is not fresh enough"". After two nights we changed to ""The",
A fantastic hotel.,"My husband and I wanted to stay somewhere special for our 10 year wedding anniversary in September. We booked nine months in advance. I started to get a wee bit nervous as there were a few mixed reviews on this website. I shouldn't have worried. We had a fantastic time. We booked a Junior Suite with a lake view. We also booked the hotel limo service to pick us up from the airport. From the moment we were greeted at the by the driver, I just knew everything was going to be fine. We checked in and had our welcome glass of champagne outside and then escorted to our room, room 212. A botlle of Champagne was on ice waiting for us, along with cheese sticks and fruit. The room itself was lovely. I could not fault it at all. It was spacious, very clean ( I'm very fussy),",
"Wonderful Property, GREAT CONCIERGE!","We wanted to visit Geneva but at the same time be away from the craziness of a truly large city and thus chose Lausanne. The Beau Rivage Palace in Lausanne is an historic property with all the modern amenities. It is directly at Lac Leman and has it own lovely garden with huge old unusual trees and is quite near the rolling hills and vineyards of the area. The Spa facility is new and the pool area is quite attractive. We enjoyed being able to go to Geneva (~30-45 minutes by car) and coming back to the tranquility of the hotel. We often consulted the Senior Concierge (Sylvie) for restaurant and winery tips (so many vineyards so near!) and were never disappointed! She was a great help! The nearby Parks (among them the Olympic Museum Art Garden) were extensive, well-maintained and",
A relaxing stay,"This hotel is right on the lakeside and has been updated in a sympathetic manner. The spa and pool area are both lovely and well-run; with an attendant making sure that everyone is accommodated. The gym was well equipped and mantained to an excellent standard. The rooms are comfortable but you have to pay for broadband and in the cheaper rooms everything is a bit beige. There is a very musty smell downstairs as you went into the less well used parts of the hotel. A lot of the staff seemed young and a bit inexperienced - they seemed to be pushed around by bossy guests! However, all this being said, the overall experience is really nice and we spent a couple of very enjoyable days here. The view across the lake is spectacular and the hotel made a very relaxing base to tour",
Beau-Rip off,"My boyfriend and I decided to traverse Europe by following the Leading Hotels of the World guide book. What a big mistake! Bad, bad things: Our room was over $1,000 per night and totally not worth it (see my pics). We had a great view of the lake and they had fresh flowers and snacks in the room when we arrived, but other than that, it just wasn't worth the dough. $10 bottles of Evian in the mini-bar and $100 HALF bottle of OK champagne. I think the burgers were like $60. So my boyfriend and I headed to a market and bought a whole case of Evian for under 10 bucks. Liquor is much cheaper there too. The people are also really snobby and not very accommodating. We hightailed it back to Germany in a jiffy after one night at the Beau Rip-off! Goodish Things: The spa is",
As good as they come (and even better than it was),I have stayed at the Beau Rivage 5 times in the past 10 years and it is one of my favourite hotels in the world. Setting is stunning. The building is grand - exuding another era - but the rooms work as (very) comfortable modern hotel rooms. I had not stayed there for about 4 years and returned February 2008 with a family of 3 young children. The most striking change is the service. I spend much of my time in Switzerland and am familiar with the slightly cold style of service in the best hotels - not great with families but fine on business. The Beau Rivage fell into this category on my last visit. This time - it was fanatastic. The place has had a Four Seasons style service make-over. Totally professional but warm and friendly. The kids were made completely welcome,
Old World Elegance in a Beautiful Setting,"The Beau Rivage Palace in Lausanne, Switzerland is not for the small of pocketbook or loud of mouth. It is an old money place that has served wealthy Europeans for generations and so if you are nosiy and like to throw your weight around this is not the place for you. My daughter and I had a wonderful stay. The service is impeccable. the staff highly trained and knowledgeable, and the rooms overlooking the lake were immaculate and extremely comfortable. Because of its geographic location, Lausanne has an interesting micro-climate so that in January when we visited, there was fog and rain, but also brilliant sunny days and a few flowers and shrubs actually in bloom. Marvelous! The only caveat I will put forth is this is not a hotel for non-smokers. It seems that people in",
Very nice hotel,"My stay was very nice. The concierge services are excellent, the sushi in the restaurant is delicious, room service wonderful and the spa is fantastic. There was no request which was not taken care of swiftly.",
Beautiful location!,"We stayed here for 5 nights over New Year's and this is a 5* luxury hotel at its best. The view of Lake Geneva with the Mountains as the backdrop is absolutely stunning!! The food was great, especially the room service and if you like sushi, try Miyako which is part of the hotel. We had a great meal there one night. The selection and quality of the breakfast buffet was exceptional. The spa facilities and spa treatments I had were stupendous. I have to say that there were a few hiccups the first 24 hours but the front desk manager made sure the issues were sorted out and even sent a bottle of champagne to our room, what better way to say sorry! We will go back for sure.",
Grand Dame needs a facelift,"We had high expectations for the Beau-Rivage, having read numerous reviews and published sources. And to be honest, from a distance, she is very stunning. The property is gorgeous and location idyllic - overlooking the shores of Lake Geneva. However, not unlike a number of historic hotels we have stayed in, she lacks modern panache and her sense of style seems to have been lost. Take for instance the spa, which has been recently overhauled and is done in a minimalist tone...which is great but doesn't flow with the rest of the property. What are they going for? Modern or traditional? The rooms are overpriced and poor value in our view (with rack rates starting at CHF 700). The bathrooms are shabby and in need of rework, with very odd ""screens"" for the showers and",
Beautiful Service and well appointed classic,"My wife and I spent the weekend recently at Beau-Rivage. It is absolutely fantastic and we were extremely happy with all aspects of the experience. The lobby is huge with lots of nooks and crannys to slide into with the newspaper. The spa, which is hard to find through a funny maze of elevators, is on the ground floor below the lobby level and is recognized as one of the most beautiful in Switzerland. My massage was fantastic and I hope to run into her again soon. Dining on the lower level consists of two of the most interesting restuarants in the areas including a sushi bar with a great array of asian tastes. The service is much better than one would expect from a stuffy old european hotel. Everything is done with a smile and with great anticipation. A great place to stay",
classy,"Beautiful building with a real sense of grandeur and luxury. Lovely room with a massive bathroom & nice extras such as robes and Bulgari toiletries. Fantastic setting looking onto the lake with the mountains in the background. Staff attentive if a little dour. Delicious food.

All round wonderful!,"Beautiful property with large lounges and great gardens to relax in. Rooms are clean, spacious and have fantastic views over the lake. A little updating needed but nothing that spoils the stay. Food was good, although a little similar in style across the different restaurants/bars.

Easy parking. All round a definate yes - but it is quite expensive... ",
Absolutely Fantasic!,"Myself and my new husband held our wedding at the Beau Rivage Palace in February and we could not have asked for a more perfect setting. The hotel is beautiful, the view from the rooms at the front of the hotel is spectacular and the surroundings and gardens were perfect. We were lucky enough to have one of the superior rooms for our wedding night which was very luxurious but we also had guests staying in the comfort rooms which were beautiful too. The staff are extremely helpful and couldn't do enough for us whilst we were there. The breakfast buffet in the morning was extensive, with everything from tasty croissants and pastries to omlettes and eggs benedict. I would definitely stay in this hotel again - very pricy but in my eyes well worth the money if you can stretch to",
What an Amazing Find! A Must Stay!,"We were staying at the Four Seasons in Geneva for 4 nights in June 2007. On our second day we asked the conceirge if there was a pleasant city along Lake Geneva to visit and stay an evening that was easily accessable by train. The concierge at the Four Seasons Geneva directed us to Lausanne and recommended the Beau Rivage Hotel for an evening. She made us promise that we would not tell her management she booked a room for us there. The Four Seasons Geneva is no shabby place, but when the concierge told me the Beau Rivage just received the ""Best Hotel in Switzerland Award 2007"" upon arrival we saw why. This luxe-palace is over the top luxurious and having travelled both on business and pleasure to several places in Switzerland, this place hands-down is the winner! An amazing",

The hotel is in a great location and truly is a leading hotel of the world - certainly earning it's reputation. The pool area and spa is excellent and it's well worth checking out one (or more!) of the many spa experiences. Staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. It was my birthday whilst we were away and the management kindly treated us to a complimentary bottle of champagne, fruit and chocolates. A very nice touch. Overall we couldn't fault the hotel or the staff. Highly recommended. ",
Fabulous resort hotel,"Don't cheat yourself if you're staying at the Beau-Rivage. Pay for a room with lakeside view, preferably in the (newer) Palace wing. The Beau-Rivage is truly one of the great hotels in Switzerland. The hotel itself is stunning, as is the location, and the staff outstanding. Some rooms, however, are on the small side. One of the great assets is the new Spa, with indoor/outdoor pool, Sauna, Turkish Bath, and more treatments than you think existed, all executed in a great Japanese-inspired oasis of tranquility and relaxation. The hotel also has a number of restaurants, with La Rotonde as the flagship, boasting one Michelin star. However, even though the food and service was great, and the Maitre 'd charming and efficient, service broke down after the main course, and I really",
Beautiful Hotel,"I spent the week of New Year's Eve at the Beau-Rivage with my family. One of the most beautiful properites I have ever seen. Lausanne is a fantastic city to explore on its own and use as a base for the Lake Geneva region. My family booked 2 rooms plus one junior suite. All accomodations were exceptional with beautifully appointed bathrooms and Bulgari bath products. Each room also had a superb view of the lake and Alps. As we were there for New Year's Eve, we were equally impressed that the hotel gave each room a bottle of champagne to celebrate the evening! We enjoyed the hotel immensely and would highly rate the concierge and his restaurant suggestions. The Cinq-Monds Spa was an added bonus to our enjoyment of the property. We would definitely stay here again! ",
Good but could be better,"Overall the hotel was very good, but it could have been better. Indeed the hotel overall is superb but the service could be better. We did get a discount rate for three nights, but it was still very expensive. There were some issues that could make it better. We stayed five nights and had a two night package for the first two nights and then room only rate for the next three nights. Our first two night package included dinner on the second night which was confirmed by email. When we checked in we were told that we had booked in the casual restaurant. This was not the case, we had booked the fine dining. We got no escort to the room which I would expect a five star hotel. The room we got was the second cheapest room and I must say it was dissapointing. The double bed was a zip",
Excellent hotel,"I stayed at Beau Rivage Palace for three nights. It is a Leading hotel and very impressive at the banks of Lake Geneva. The room rate was about 400 CHF/night without breakfast (about 250,00 Euro). The room on the frisr floor was well and rich equipped, the bathroom had an seperate shower stall, a jacuzzi and good toilettries. The whole property was very clean, the spa with inside and outside pool very generous. The staff was good, but not world class (e.g.the bell captain had chewing gum in the mouth when arriving, the air condition did not work at arrival and I had to call twice within three hours for service, and the bath robe was not replaced twice although laying on the floor). Very good was the room service with a delicious menu for moderate prices and terrific is",
Best Hotel Ever,"We stayed at this hotel recently during the world triathlon champs.We had a fabulous room (which was HUGE) -our son was staying with us also.The bathroom was also HUGE with a separate toilet ,spa bath and separate shower.The hotel was exceptional in every way.It has recently been extensively renovated and provides all the modern services necessary to a 5 star hotel including a beautiful spa,gym,pool complex.The staff were fantastic and even though they were extremely busy they were always very obliging.The hotel is on the shores of the lake at Ouchy and has wonderful vistas.It has very grand reception areas,restaurants and bars.We could definitely see why it has been voted European Hotel of the Year for the last several years ",
Wonderful Hotel on the Lake,"My wife and I spent five nights at the Beau-Rivage Place in late August and would highly recommend the experence. The only problem while we were their was that the subway that takes you from the harbor, and which is about 200 yards from the hotel, was closed so we had to rely on cabs or the bus to get into town or to the train station for day trips. The grounds of this hotel are truly magnificant as is the location on the lake and steps from the waterfront path on which you can ride bikes practically forever. Our room in the new section (Around 1900 but It looks older that the old section.) was large and very well appointed with two french doors opening onto a balcony overlooking the lake, the gardens and the supersized chess board. The bathroom was the size of the room we",
Excellent Stay,Having spent 5 nights at BRP at the end of July I feel the last 2 postings are somewhat unfair. I travelled with my partner and 3 month old baby and found the service levels incredibly high. Any query or question I had was dealt with proficiently and promptly at both conceirge and reception. Everyday we needed bottles sterilised for the baby and the staff came to the room immediately. Furthermore the bottles were returned within 10 minutes on each occasion. Our luggage was also in the room within 5 minutes. Sevice levels at the Spa/swimming pool and the Rotonde restaurant were indeed very good - my only bad experience (and I'm being very picky now) was at the Le Bar one lunch time - it just took the waitress slightly longer to take my order than I had anticipated. Not wishing,
Absolutely worth every penny!,"The Beau-Rivage is the true definition of a palatial 5-star hotel! After staying there for 2 nights, we were completely relaxed and felt very well taken care of by the staff (despite previous reviewers' comments). Our check-in was quick, our rooms were standard, yet each one had its own unique character, along with Bulgari bath amenities, a jacuzzi, and brand-new fixtures. The staff was very courteous and tried to do whatever they could to make our stay more comfortable. However, I would not recommend the hotel restaurant (the Cafe), as it is quite overpriced and we felt a bit sick after our meal. Also, we checked out the Lausanne Palace Hotel and although the interior was very sophisticated, its location was nothing compared to the gorgeous location of the Beau-Rivage. If you",
Sit on a bench by the Lake and take in the view,"The only compliment we can give this hotel is the location. Unfortunately, the view from our balcony was the only pleasure we experienced. The staff is incompetent, unforgiving, and rude. We did nothing but observed how they treated us and many other guests. They seem to have internal staff problems, especially at the front desk and we were greeted with this nasty exchange upon our arrival which interferred with our luggage not arriving at our room until 45 minutes later. We also asked for reservations to the restaurant, the front desk assured us they would inquire about the reservations and get back to us, which they did not do for over two hours whereby they informed us at our dinner time that it was fully booked. Our room key was misplaced twice, our car keys were misplaced",
"OK - needs improvement (from London, UK)","It is supposed to be one of the leading hotels in the world. Thats the problem. Any hiccup is therefore viewed with alarm. It is a beautiful hotel with a great location by the lake. The pool is excellent and so is the spa. What is lacking is the service. We stayed 3 nights to celebrate our anniversary, in a superior room which can have jacuzzis if requested in advance. We requested 3 months in advance with a package. I even emailed a few days before arrival to confirm and was assured. On arrival - what a surprise - all rooms with jacuzzi were full. At other prestigious hotels I have stayed in, this would have been rectified with an apology and an upgrade. Not here. Front desk are poor. What else? It took an hour to get our luggage from the porter after check in! Housekeeping",
"Very good, but not the best hotel in Lausanne.","We stayed at the Beau-Rivage from June 4-6, 2005. First of all, the hotel IS beautiful. It is very grand, the rose gardens are beautiful, and the location on the shores of Lac Leman is great. Just a couple of notes...there is considerable construction right outside the back entrance (I think they're building a swimming pool) which detracts a little bit from the experience. Also, the spa is under construction and will not be open until the fall of 2005. If a spa is important to you, stay instead at the Lausanne Palace. I e-mailed the hotel before our arrival requesting a reservation at the Cafe Beau-Rivage on Friday at 9:00 p.m. When we checked in at 7:30 p.m., the reservation had not been made and they expressed concern about us receiving a reservation because ""...it is",
Divine,From the moment you arrive you know it’s going to be a special experience - it was for us. Book yourself in to their Michelin starred restaurant and you’ll think you’ve died and gone to heaven. Worth every penny. ,
Excellence by the Lake,"I stayed here just overnight on a business trip. As a member of the Leading Hotels of World Club I was upgraded to a junior suite, with the most wonderful views of the lake from two balconies. I am always a little cautious about great grand hotels, like the Beau-Rivage, and prefer the modern contemporary feel of a modern Four Seasons. But this place is great. The room was traditional but not old. Everything was pristine and in working order, and my high speed internet worked like a dream. The Bathroom was massive and although not ultra modern with trendy limestone, it was very nicely fitted. The bed was devine and I slept like a baby. Room service was so rapid, it was as if they knew what you were going to order before you called. The staff were all utterly professional and",
The Best Ever!,"We were in Lausanne in May for our honeymoon, and this hotel was the best ever! We had a suite for 3 nights and enjoyed every minute! We dined at one of the resturants which was excellent. Would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Lausanne. ",
loved this hotel!,"This hotel is truely a 5 star hotel in every sense of the word. The grounds are beautiful. The hotel is impecably clean and rooms are very nice. The different sitting rooms around the hotel are also beautiful. The breakfast is one of a kind. The restaurants are also 1st rate.They treat you like royalty. Also, right on Lake Geneva. Great location. Just 1 block from the metro and across the street from the boat to montreux or Evian,France. We would highly recommend this very classy hotel! ",
Amazingly beautiful hotel!,"Beau Rivage is no doubt a very expensive hotel. But, if you are staying in Lausanne, and can afford it, it's a beautiful hotel to stay at. I was there for a wedding, and it was just amazing to say the least. We were able to get a wedding rate, which eased the burden a bit. Our room was a comfort room (probably the cheapest they had), but it was fantastic, and we even had a glimpse of the lake. The rooms are beautifully furnished, beds are comfortable with down comforters, and the bathrooms are glistening (although I don't get why the shower curtains are only half the size of the shower, so you end up getting the floor wet). Regardless, the rooms and the food are what you'd expect of a 5 star hotel. The bar was great as well, as was the food at restaurants in the hotel. The",
