"Baur au Lac",,"Bullseye","“It gets no better”, the great Bowen, James, of this parish once intoned and, verily I say unto you, it doesn’t. I could be down to my last £1,000, I’d still stay in the BaL, I could be destitute and starving, indeed I probably am destitute and starving, and this would be one of the memories, Arsenal in 1989 would be higher, I admit, but this would be a memory that I would hold dear, that I would hold in my pantheon. The memory that I, an immodest Englishman of three score years, could deign to stay in what is, quite simply, the best hotel in the world. Full stop and I never mentioned Sepp Blatter."
"Baur au Lac",,"A most lovely family reunion at Baur au Lac","A family get-together was made extra special by the beautiful setting and wonderful staff at Baur au Lac. Vanessa and Marlana at the front desk were always welcoming and most attentive to our every need. We received complimentary chocolates, champagne and petit-fours which were most delicious. We enjoyed a gorgeous meal at Baur’s Brasserie, which successfully balances both a refined and relaxed atmosphere, under the expert leadership of manager Rachelle. Breakfasts at Baur au Lac are definitely the best way to start the day, with a great selection from buffet and a la carte (the French toast will live on in my dreams!) and welcoming smiles and great attention from Dagmara and Patricia. The location of Baur au Lac could not be more perfect – views of the lake while only a few"
"Baur au Lac",,"Strong Recommendation","Great location, awesome hotel, excellent service. Travelling a lot for business and to me the Baur au Lac is one of the best city hotels in Europe. Already looking forward to my next stay! Thanks and congrats to the whole BAL team!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Ultimate luxury","We throughly enjoyed our stay here. I know it was one of the largest sites that we stayed and find it expensive but it was ultimate luxury. Service, accommodation, location and food was great. We look forward to return in summer again. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Baur au Lac holiday","An incredible and fabulous vacation! One of the best days ever! We liked everything from the classic and authentic look of the hotel itself, the view of the canal from the room window, delicious and exquisite food to the wonderful festive atmosphere and friendly staff. We are already planning and looking forward to the next meeting!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Leave me be!","I feel caught in an Orwellian nightmare. I have reviewed this hotel five thousand times, never less than five stars and yet, and yet, I keep being asked to review it again. Please, sheathe your sword! Abate from these requests! What more can I add? The concierge recognised me? Of course he did! I am extremely attractive and charismatic though, occasionally, recognised as a younger Elton John who is not extremely attractive……."
"Baur au Lac",,"Great atmosphere of a truly unique hotel","Baur au Lac, after 3 years of visiting Zurich at least twice a year, has become our home away from home. Hard to say why, it is as simple as feeling treated naturally with true kindness and interest in our wellbeing."
"Baur au Lac",,"A good address","Very hospitable staff. The room was luxurious and the bedding was top quality. The room service is super fast with great quality. Air conditioning was not cooling and though I had a manager look at it, I had a very warm night's sleep!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Highly recommended","A very elegant experience. Despite a gap in communication on airport pickup, the staff capably mitigated the situation. Very comfortable bed with luxurious linen. The room service were Swiss accuracy and quality. A highly recommended hotel."
"Baur au Lac",,"Disappointed by HouseKeeping","I have stayed at the Baur Au Lac multiple times over the years. It had always been such a pleasure to be there because the service had been flawless in all respects. I just returned to the hotel for the first time since Covid and I am sad to say that the standards have slipped. While the team at the front of the house - drivers, concierge, front desk, restaurant staff - are still first rate, the housekeeping services have been a great disappointment. For every day during my stay (three days so far), I have had to ask for my mini bar to be replenished, and for soap and shampoo to be regularly replaced. In a hotel the caliber of the Baur Au Lac, I should not have to ask for these things to be done. Today, the third day of my stay, I called housekeeping at 8:15 am and requested"
"Baur au Lac",,"Spectacular stay","It’s a beautiful, historic hotel that overlooks Lake Zurich. The location is perfect because of its proximity to the old town. The rooms are spacious and beautiful. The sitting area on the ground floor and the breakfast room were both absolutely gorgeous. The staff were very courteous and helpful."
"Baur au Lac",,"The best in Zürich","It's always a huge pleasure to stay at Baur au lac. I live in Switzerland but sometimes spend a weekend at Baur au lac. I wanted to give special thanks to the outstanding service from the room service team on this particular trip. I had some special needs for my room and they were most accommodating!!! Thank you Lotfi, Lionel, Sirinapa, and all the team for your most attentive service!!! Everything else was great too!!! Thank you. The only thing that is challenging at Baur au lac is the wine list. It probably has the most inflated prices for wine of any hotel in Switzerland. For someone who enjoys good wine and prefer to drink water as opposed to mediocre wine, this can be very challenging. Thanks again for a lovely stay."
"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic Hotel in the centre of Zurich","Excellent service, fantastic rooms and very attentive staff. Always stay here in Zurich at the end of a trip. Rooms are well appointed and bed is fantastic. Breakfasts are the highlight for me. Close to all shops and restaurants and everything in walking distance"
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful stay at the Baur au Lac","We had a wonderful, romantic, stay at the Baur au Lac. The condition of the hotel and its rooms was fantastic and elegant. The service was top-notch and accommodating. The proximity to the tram lines made getting to and from the airport a breeze. We greatly appreciated the beautiful garden of the hotel, which was a nice private retreat from the bustle of the city."
"Baur au Lac",,"Very nice service","We had a wonderful stay in this hotel although we had requested a good view but unfortunately we were given two connecting rooms on the 1st floor with literally no view and due to the construction going on we were shown another room but was directly facing the construction site and had no shower room only a bathtub. plus the layout of our room was not practical for us. but nevertheless the service of the entire hotel staff was outstanding . the breakfast was good quality healthy breakfast and the ambience was superb in the beautiful garden. The driver who picked us up from the airport Khalid was a wonderful and extremely helpful gentleman. Honestly even the doorkeepers and the housekeeping staff all were super helpful . We loved our stay and will opt to come back hopefully to a"
"Baur au Lac",,"Horrible hotel","We recently stayed at this hotel; this was an anniversary stay. Almost everything about this hotel was a disappointment. The view from our room was of a green construction tarp, there was no sunlight in the room, we felt as if we were staying in a noisy box. TheTerrace Restaurant, their outdoor place, was frequently closed for special events, this was the only place to get drinks and cocktails and a light dinner. The breakfast was awful-the food was of poor quality, fake maple syrup for pancakes and fruit-not fresh but looking like it was out of a can. We did not enjoy our stay at this hotel, for over $900/nt we expected better. There are plenty of nice hotels on the water that are very nice. This hotel is NOT on or near the water and it is not a luxury hotel. We've traveled"
"Baur au Lac",,"Unforgettable 1st Zurich experience","Fantastic experience at this breathtaking hotel. The staff was remarkable and service was impeccable. Warm and friendly people in a beautiful environment! From arrival to departure, I was treated with respect and attentiveness. The decor is lovely and the hotel location is just ideal."
"Baur au Lac",,"Unmatched Location & Staff","Baur au Lac truly is a magical experience. It sits in the most beautiful location in perhaps the nicest city in the world, and has the most professional & helpful staff I have ever encountered. Taking a walk around it's facilities, and one can clearly see that they have spared no expense making this place the most all encompassing and beautiful place."
"Baur au Lac",,"TEW","Fabulous hotel with remarkable location and service. The rooms and facilities are beautiful. The staff extremely friendly and efficient. A wonderful hotel. The food is superb. Zurich is a great place to visit and I look Foy to returning."
"Baur au Lac",,"Simply the best","The Baur au Lac has a perfect location situated on a private park right next to the lake and within very short walking distance of Bahnhofstrasse. There is no need to talk about the rooms or the amenities, they are at a level that you would expect from a 5 Star Hotel. What really separates the Baur au Lac from other luxury hotels is the staff. Wherever I go in the hotel, I am always being greeted by name and with a smile. The service quality is simply unparalleled and I feel like coming home whenever I arrive at the Baur au Lac"

"Baur au Lac",,"Another Great Experience at Baur au Lac","The Baur Au Lac is our choice in Zurich. Hotel’s location is great. The concierge service is terrific. The breakfast buffet is outstanding and the terrace is great for cocktails. Our room was large with a double vanity in the bathroom. Service throughout our stay was excellent. Cannot imagine staying anywhere else when in Zurich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Exceptional Swiss hospitality","Was delighted to return to the Baur au Lac. Had a wonderful dinner at their fine dining restaurant and another on their terrace. This hotel has both a perfect location and also a very passionate and dedicated long standing staff who care about every small detail. Special thanks to Andrea Kracht for making it an exceptional stay for my birthday."
"Baur au Lac",,"Most awful terrible experience","Wonder how can this hotel ever get a single good review . To begin with the hitel is under renovation so the entrance is make short at the back … no mention of this when you book or on their website . We continue our entry . Right from the word start they were just so cold . “Of course we will give you the best “ . Is how you are welcomed when you request for a hood room with a view. We are taken to our room and we Lok out to a construction building with net on it. And that’s the only view … there is a trolly out as a make shift for tea coffee In The room . The two chairs shown in the picture of . A deluxe double room are pushed away !! We request for a change of room we are taken to a smaller room with view of the canal form the balcony .. surely not acceptable !! "
"Baur au Lac",,"Absolute stunning stay!!!!","Whao... Where do I start. It was my honeymoon stay from South Africa and I was amazed about the professionalism and perfection guests are treated. The shuttle picked us up from the airport. One of our bags was left behind in Doha but the shuttle driver was very patient with us and so we left for the hotel. The check in was amazing. The staff treated us like royalty. We were upgraded with our Diners Club program and was allocated a Junior Suite... it was absolute perfection from door to door. The inside was a perfect setting for a romantic night and trsnquiled stay. The breakfast was fantastic. With so much to choose from (both hot and cold) The cheese selection was astonishing with ample to choose from. My wife was coughing during our arrival and so the concierge organised"
"Baur au Lac",,"Old World hospitality with Michelin star food and service.","This hotel is an institution. With a prominent position overlooking Lake Zurich, close to everything (10 min walk to train station); staying here was the right choice after a week long cruise in the Rhine. Employees excel at providing personalized services. Everything is luxurious in a world class way. From the linens to the old carpets. Still, immaculate and clean. What some people call outdated, I find refreshingly elegant and reliable. Not for Millennials in search for flavor of the month, techie venue. Quiet and proper. Decent gym with amazing views of Lake Zurich. Comfortable bed with water provided at all times. Only complain; no coffee machine. But room service was off charts. I think they have the best room service of any hotel I have visited. And their Michelin"
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury and swiss quality service","First time at the Baur au Lac, the team made us feel at home all the way. We had a wonderful short stay and the rooms were beautifully designed just as expected from such a great luxury hotel. We will be back!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury with a friendly touch","In Zurich for Christmas shopping, we enjoyed a wonderful short stay at this iconic hotel. The room was very spacious, with a sumptuous and comfortable bed, quiet and with pleasant lighting. Bathroom with great amenities. But overall, staff is the hotel greatest asset. Thank you very much"
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful Hotel","Great hotel. The decor is amazing. The details in the room are just perfect. Service is wonderful as well. But housekeeping is rude. I have long hair and tangles easily. I asked for extra conditioner and the lady said we already put one! I said know but I need two and she was thoroughly annoyed. Kind of weird attitude for such a high end hotel. The restaurants and lounges are superb. I would stay again but I would avoid interaction with housekeeping!!!!!! PS I love that the windows open."
"Baur au Lac",,"Sublime","This is the third time I have told TA that the BaL is the finest hotel in the world. It’s almost biblical. Did not Peter deny our Lord three times? Is not the Trinity made f Three? Thus, for the third time, I am going to utter the immortal phrase of which Man should be made aware. The Baur au Lac in Zurich is, was, and always will be the finest hotel in the world. Full Stop"
"Baur au Lac",,"Exceptional Property with a Fantastic Team","I enjoyed a fantastic stay at this beautiful property in October 2021. From check-in to check-out my stay was flawless. My room was beautifully appointed and very comfortable. The entire team was so welcoming and friendly and could not have been kinder. I would like to extend a special ""Thank you"" to the Concierge team who ensured my stay was so special. Thank you very much to Khalid, Imad, Jérémie and Roberto. I also enjoyed the wonderful dining options-both Baur's and Le Hall. I look forward to returning again soon to this exceptional property."
"Baur au Lac",,"VERY BAD","We were not satisfied with many things. A very stingy hotel, they didn't even put a dental kit, they brought it to our room after telling them how many times, but they didn't renew the cleaning time. The breakfast was bad, the prices were very high. Even though we stayed in the Junior Suite room, the room was very boring, there was no refreshment etc. We were not satisfied with anything except 1-2 waiters. We will definitely not choose this hotel again. and again they took money from our card for no reason."
"Baur au Lac",,"Palace Excellence At Its Best","The Baur au Lac is a family jewel for over 5 generations of hoteliers. All went through the famed Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne, the Harvard of F&B post grad studies. And it shows. Everything is in the (many) details that differentiates an hotel from a palace. First the welcome at the entrance is a welcome. You do not wander around the lobby. You’re being accompanied to a quick check in and within minutes to your room. Rooms are of high quality, large, clear, modern & contemporary with beautiful marble bathrooms and every amenities you can think of. Several restaurants are waiting for your lunch or dinner, all highly rated. And they deserve their rating -thus I only had dinner at the Brasserie Baur- a very good business dinner. Do not miss the lobby bar, by the chimney, it is a"
"Baur au Lac",,"Heaven on Earth","This hotel is superlative in all we experienced during our stay. Le Hall - amazing set up. Baur's - French flavor and great food and drinks. Room - sumptuous. The team - made us feel we were the only ones. If you wish for a stay to remember just go to Baur au Lac."
"Baur au Lac",,"Disappointed Baur au lac","I booked a Room at Baur au Lac in Zurich with the souvenir of wonderful past trips to ZÜrich in an hotel that was legendary to me in my mind. Over the last 10 years I have travelled around the world and were lucky enough to enjoy the luxury of 5* hotel. To me it’s always an experience and a wonderful moment when you are far away from home. But sadly this trip came with a huge disappointment. The Baur à Lac doesn’t match t it’s 5* status. The lobby is old and sad, the elevator carpet need a change, the clientele as lost it’s glamorous vibe. The Michelin star restaurant opens only on Saturday, the one I ended having dîner is so disappointing that even Pizza Hut would have been better. Bref all is sad here. The biggest shock came 10min after my arrival. After having booked a room"
"Baur au Lac",,"Everything was great, and the staff was extremely service minded.","Everything was great, and the staff was extremely service minded. We loved the welcome at the hotel with a short guided tour. The room was really nice and clean. Room Service was fast. It was a pleasure to be at the hotel travelling with our dog. And finally, the breakfast included in the price was 'à la carte'. The service and food were great, ad the dishes were served at high speed. We will definitely come back."
"Baur au Lac",,"One of the best hotels we have stayed at.","Stayed at this hotel for the 1st time. It’s one of the most beautiful hotels we have stayed at with impeccable service. Location of the hotel is amazing walking distance to all the good restaurants and high end shopping. Special mention for one of the best concierge forget his name but he is from Lebanon."
"Baur au Lac",,"World class hotel in unbeatable location!","Stayed there for three days with the entire family. From arrival to departure, it was an absolute top-notch experience. The colleagues are extremely welcoming, accommodating and never mind to go out of their way. The rooms are very comfortable and immaculately cleaned. We wish we could have stayed longer and will definitely return - worth every cent."
"Baur au Lac",,"Great - But missing a few things","Fantastic legendary hotel in the very heart of Zurich. The grounds are beautiful and the service is excellent. PROS: Perfect location, very attentive service, beautiful renovated Junior Suites with amazing decoration, very nice Terrace restaurant with a chic lounge vibe, beautiful garden CONS: Lobby looks a bit dated, no Spa/pool and no state-of-the-art gym (small fitness room), no expresso/tea machine in room"
"Baur au Lac",,"The most beautiful Hotel in Zurich","Very nice hotel with a great ambiance and amazing staff. Coming back here time to time is a bless! The service is perfection and they accommodate every request. Special thank you to Lenka, Stefanie, Max and the charming italian server at Baur's -whose name I am missing- to make and maintain this place very unique!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great great great","Fantastic stay! Great service, nice rooms, very friendly staff, nice location! The food is great , the breakfast is good. Call for very good offers for the room rates and combinations. We are extremely happy with our stay. The hotel restaurants are worth the experience "
"Baur au Lac",,"Perfect weekend getaway","“The Baur au Lac, internationally renowned as one of the world's top luxury hotels, an establishment steeped in over 175 years of tradition, has been owned by the same family for six generations. Being one of the world's oldest luxury hotels still in the ownership of its founding family the Baur au Lac represents modernity and progressivity at the same time. Over the last decades, some 160 million Swiss francs have been invested in new facilities and renovations at the Baur au Lac.”"
"Baur au Lac",,"Quick stop - amazing place","We stopped over for a short stay and we’re just amazed by the quality of services and the generous rooms. Also a stop at the Baurs restaurant did not disappoint. Recommend to everyone even on a short Weekend stay- real relief and beautiful environment during these challenging times. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Great hotel","Loved the hotel. Very nice decor and appeal to it when you enter. The rooms are simple and elegant. Very antique feel to it. Overall a good vibe. Recommended stay in Zurich. You can explore the city easily and close to public transport "
"Baur au Lac",,"Magical stay within Zurich City","I have visited the Baur au Lac many times, mostly for drinks or lunch, but this time, I stayed for a night and I have to say: even more marvelous. The staff is super friendly, they try to have your wishes ready before you even know you'd like to wish for it. From the hotel rooms to the dining possibilities within the whole hotel: it feels like a little trip to wonderland but once you step outside, you're in midst of the busy Zurich city and you can easily visit nearby cafés, restaurants, museums or just enjoy the beautiful view over Lake Zurich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Snobby","A good place to share a Tea or to have a lunch, unfortunate is the attention at the desk in the Lobby, as we arrived, we asked to make a reservation for a typical Afternoon tea and a second reservation for a lunch at Baur’s a separate day. The attention was quite annoying, the negative attitude of the head waiter for the booking left me with no grace to reserve, “no place we are fully booked for the month, we requested any day to reserve as we were flexible. No chance.. But my surprise was that minutes later, making the same request by phone, we got a table in the lobby for the Tea one day and for the requested a table for 4 at Bauer’s. The Tea service a classic in the Lobby was excellent, service and attention unique, for the Lunch at Bauer’s we really enjoy the service the"
"Baur au Lac",,"Spontaneous dinner","Amazing night there! The quality in general is awesome ; service, drinks, food, the atmosphere, don't forget to have a sit on the couch in the fumoir and taste some delicious cigare with a good spirit. Chill and fancy. Delicious and tasty. Go for it!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Lunch at the Brasserie","I would like to send you a new review about the Baur au lac in Zurich! We had yesterday the 24th of October 2020 lunch with friends in the Brasserie of the hotel mentioned above. They have renovated the restaurant and it did turn out very, very beautiful. The food and service was absolutely excellent. The only thing they still have to work on is there BABA ou RUM it is not very good, the pastry 🥮 was far to try. We thought the cook did keep the Rum for himself. With my very best regards Mrs. C. Steiger - Maldaque"
"Baur au Lac",,"Best of the best in Zurich","It's such a beautiful hotel, my personal favourite in Zurich! The rooms are spacious, elegant and just fabulous. Breakfast in that lovely pavillon is always a highlight, even if currently no buffet can be offered, the variety is large and the service is fast - really enjoyable. The staff members were super charming, from the friendly receptionist upon arrival to the lovely lady taking care of my order at breakfast, it's an amazing service. Unfortunately nobody has a name tag but they are all great ambassadors of true luxury service."
"Baur au Lac",,"Ultimate Grand Style & Luxury","Swiss hotel standards have diminished over the years as standards of service have become worse and worse. But at Baur au Lac it is family run, and it shows. The cuisine at the Terrasse is modern and fitting to the most spectacular garden that faces the lake. The garden has two most magnificent trees, one Japanese Ginko planted over a hundred years ago, and the other is just as impressive. Facing the lake the garden has an art in the park sculpture is awesome. The suite I stayed had the charm and modern luxury with a fantastic shower and bathroom area. The bed is impeccable and the overall impression is grand elegance and luxury in the centre if the city."

"Baur au Lac",,"The Garden","We had a short stay with family. We felt particularly well taken care of in these difficult COVID times. Having a garden in the middle of the city was a huge plus and the staff was caring and personable. We liked the food choices and especially the very attentive breakfast. "
"Baur au Lac",,"True Palace Hotel style. Unbeatable service and central location","Don't know of any other hotel open to the public since 175 years. That is certainly a distinctive tag, but what is really remarkable is the incomparable service, with extremely well trained and cheering staff. Food is above any standard in terms of quality and fresh ingredients, atmosphere is what one can dream about when thinking on those belle epoque times when luxury hotels were measured by how comfortable they were able to make guests feel. Being within short walking distance to any point in central Zurich is an added value to all those others great details."
"Baur au Lac",,"Impeccable service, amazing hotel and location","Do not stay anywhere else in Zurich but Baur Au Lac! We were here for one night for our wedding anniversary and we were upgraded to a suite with a lake view balcony. Absolutely stunning! We sat on the lawn terrace for drinks and since the room was so nice, we ordered room service and had the Wagyu burgers- best burger and fries I have ever had. The service was very good- everyone was very polite and friendly. Top notch hotel and they know how to treat their guests. I only have good things to say about this hotel, the people who work there, the service, the atmosphere and the food. Thank you for giving us an amazing stay. Definitely 5-star worthy."
"Baur au Lac",,"Just Right","A great old hotel with large , comfortable rooms and friendly staff. Located right near Zurich’s main retail street of Bahnhofstrasse walking from this hotel means everything is within easy reach. Can’t pick any faults with this one."
"Baur au Lac",,"Exhilarating Afternoon Tea at Le Halls","The Afternoon Tea at the Le Halls, Baur au Lac was extremely refreshing and wonderful. We were supposed to meet our business associates for tea and they chose this enchanting place. It was a relaxing experience . The service is excellent and the cakes and scones are lovely. Their honey is a "" must try"" because it is harvested from a bee hive in their garden. My special compliment to Ms Antonio who patiently explains the different types of pastries and sandwiches to us. Her cheerfulness and enthusiasm adds more excitement to the afternoon tea . I will definitely do it again the next time I visit Zurich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Grand Hotel","Treat yourself to a stay at Baur au Lac. The hotel is perfectly located on the lake and you can easily walk to countless restaurants and sights. We walked to and from the main train station on a couple of occasions and it's only about 10-15 minutes walk and very scenic. The staff are attentive, the service is excellent and a bit old fashioned (in a GOOD way). We stayed in a junior suite with a balcony overlooking the canal and down toward the lake. Some rooms overlook the hotel's private gardens/park and toward the lake, which must be lovely, too. Our room was beautifully appointed, impeccably clean and spacious. The bathroom in particular felt very luxurious. The minibar is free, which is such a nice touch in a luxury hotel. We had drinks in the restaurant and coffee in"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great service and great food!","We stayed two nights in Baur au Lac with family. It was a pleasant welcome from the entrance and guided through the room. Nice atmosphere and convenient location. We came back to the hotel very late which the restaurants were closed and we were too tired to go out. We ordered Bolognese pasta with some snacks. This simple dish was so tasty. We had the best Bolognese ever and the children keep on talking about it. Thank you for the experience. We will be back!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Room For Improvement...sadly, this hotel is losing its crown","The Buar Au Lac is one of those city hotels that is known throughout Switzerland: its position on the lake front, just two hops from the Bahnhofstrasse, is hard to fault. However the service and guest reception has slipped badly. Arriving on 25th, I was greeted by Florence and Nina and we had the standard discussion (which seems to be de rigeur in luxury hotels today),where the receptionists insist they have to pre-authorise CH200.00 per day on my credit card [for ""Extras""] and the whole cost of the stay. I explain that my credit card has a limit and will 'block' if more than a certain amount is put through each day. Florence stares glassily at me. I ask her to check how many visits I have made to the hotel and whether I have always paid my account. She agrees that I have"
"Baur au Lac",,"Some of the best service in the world","I stayed for a short business trip at the Baur au Lac and I was reminded that across the board in every position the service in this hotel is superb--the doorman, the reception, the concierge, the restaurant staff. Basically, it is the most warm, flawless service anywhere. At the last minute they arranged for an early check in and also a hair salon appointment. They came upstairs immediately when I had a computer issue which I managed to solve as they arrived--but the response was immediate. The buffet breakfast is a dream and the service wonderful and they indulged me in speaking German. The hotel is also beautiful--the public areas (love the pavilion restaurant) and the rooms and the location is close to everything and great for running. This hotel is just special."
"Baur au Lac",,"New Year’s Eve","We spent the final night of our 16 day European holiday at Baur au Lac. I highly recommend booking transfers through the hotel because we absolutely loved our driver. The Mercedes S Class pick-up and the Rolls Royce airport drop-off were both seamless. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were warmly welcomed and shown to our room. For my birthday, they had a cute chocolate cake set up in our room, which was a nice touch. Having come from staying in a spectacular suite at the Four Seasons Florence, the room at Baur au Lac was just OK. The room was small and a bit dated, as was the bathroom. For the price point, the room was a disappointment. Service was outstanding. Mr. von Rechenberg was a wonderful and welcoming host throughout our stay. He is a true asset to Baur au Lac. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Baur au Lac","One of the Luxury Collection Hotels, Baur au Lac lives up to its reputation. The hotel opened in 1844 and is still owned by the original family (6th generation). The rooms are immaculate. They offer a pillow menu, free stocked mini bar and their bath essentials (shampoo etc) are LaBottega products. The Christmas decorations and chocolate treats I found in my room daily put me in the festive mood. The location is ideal for sightseeing, shopping and Lake Zurich. All is within walking distance. Pavilion Restaurant is on site with two star Michelin Chef Laurent Eperon. If you wish to have dinner there make reservations in advance. The dinner is a culinary adventure of taste. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Perfect hotel","Nice reception by the bell captain. Lovely quiet room, though far to get there. Wonderful Pavillon restaurant, stupendous food and service. Nice breakfast buffet. Good location. Nice lobby with a beautiful Christmas tree."
"Baur au Lac",,"Top Zurich Hotel","The Baur au Lac is a truly world-class five star property. No detail is overlooked by the magnific staff who look after every detail to ensure you have a pleasant and comfortable stay. Truly make you feel at home every time. The food is fantastic and room service is reliable; Baur’s is excellent. And the concierge staff are truly the crown jewel of this property; Jeremie and his colleagues will ensure your every whim is addressed. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Zürich’s Grand White Lady","Compared to so many other 5* hotels, the Baur au Lac, always lived up to the most critical of expectations. We have stayed at this hotel for over more than a decade. The hotel never got ‘tired’ and rooms are regularly up-dated and fresh without losing its timeless elegance that you have become accumstomed to. We liked the refurbishment of the corner-suite. All is like new, yet the style is maintained. Service and politeness of staff is world class. This hotel is not your cheapest choise - luxury has got its price."
"Baur au Lac",,"Top of the game","We passed by this stunning property on a last minute road trip to Zurich! And what a place it is. From the moment you enter you are transformed back in time to the grandeur of the good old times. The hotel is meticulous from top to bottom. Parts have been newly renovated such as the brasserie and the bar. Rooms are beautiful and perfectly maintained. At the bar, Negroni is amazing and the service from its team (young Italian gentleman, couldn’t get the name) was personalized, welcoming and excellent. David, overseeing the food and beverage, was amazing and what made me write this review! A true hospitality person and amazing host! Happy and looking forward to come back at some point. "

"Baur au Lac",,"The fifth star fell off","This is a great hotel, probably the best in Zurich, on this trip it wasn’t its usual five star deluxe hotel. Too many things went wrong. Housekeeping, breakfast, coffee lounge etc. Management need to sharpen their pencils and watch out... Other guests shared similar complaints. Love this place and don’t want to see it go down. I love their new addition Baur’s restaurant."
"Baur au Lac",,"We will return","This was a very fleeting stay en route to Luzern with my mum. Great location by lake with beautiful terrace. The hotel is very exquisite and all staff were friendly and professional....sadly stay was far too short ... we will return and will book a room with a view next time "
"Baur au Lac",,"Not quite perfect","I have always been a fan of this stately Swiss hotel. The position besides the lake is just perfect and the terrace is the nicest place I know in Zurich for a drink on a summer’s evening. The staff are always charming and the rooms super comfortable. The tablets in the rooms through which one can order room service are a great innovation. So this morning’s breakfast was a surprise - the toast was burnt, the cappuccino was tepid and the birchermuesli was (at least to my taste) far too sweet. Ah well, we all have off days."
"Baur au Lac",,"One of the best hotels in Switzerland","Had the most decadent, opulent and luxurious stay here for a week and wished it would have been for longer. We are definitely returning again soon and I cannot wait. Thank you so much for making our stay a truly memorable experience."
"Baur au Lac",,"A superb hotel with wonderfully friendly and helpful staff.","Nice sized room, spotlessly clean. Very comfortable. Hotel is walking distance to main shopping street and lake ferry terminal. Be sure to dine at their two starred restaurant, Pavillion. Buffet breakfast excellent. Highly recommended."
"Baur au Lac",,"Best Hotel in Europe","I would say best 5 star hotel in Europe stayed 3 days with my mum in Zurich July 29th to 31st and decided this time stay in Baur au Lac and I would say bene the best ever ,in terms of rooms , staff , service, location ,luxury ,architect , culture , atmosphere ,food ,business centre ,gym ..... I have been to different nice hotels for business and pleasure the strip to Europe and in the past but never been impressed this much , I highly recommend this hotel , Front office supervisor Leuza ,concierge. restaurant staff ,all were the best ."
"Baur au Lac",,"Business and Pleasure Stay with Baur au Lac","My husband, Zach, was traveling to Zurich for work for a week and I joined him to relax and enjoy the city and we chose to stay at the lovely Baur au Lac, which I would recommend to anyone. This hotel is absolutely beautiful with unique artwork and perfect service. Multiple dining options, all of which are fabulous. There's a very detailed and updated workout facility on the top floor that I utilized every day. The proximity of the hotel to the city center couldn't be more convenient. It is quiet but right in the middle of Zurich. We loved it here and are looking forward to going back!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Lovely food and location","Quite a relaxed place to eat but also formal. The waiting staff were excellent and the food superb. I had a light lunch of gazpacho and lemon sorbet which was excellent. It's obviously quite expensive but I'd go back there anytime."
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful girlfriends lunch in the Hall","It is indeed a while ago, actually before summer, yet still an unforgettable lunch. I come sometimes with a few friends for teatime, but this time, as it was too early for tea and we felt rather hungry, we decided spontaneously for lunch and - we had a wonderful and unforgettable time at the Baur au Lac. Like with every visit, there is always a person, who stands out - this time it was a young lady, named Sara, who was very professional yet friendly and knew our wishes without having to ask. Due to her very welcoming and naturally professional service, this lunch was one of our finest we ever had in Zurich. Many thanks to Sara and the rest of the team. Diane B."
"Baur au Lac",,"Superb Hotel","Visited Zurich and stayed in this classy hotel by the end of June 2019, From the warm welcome upon arrival,check in process, restaurant services, room cleanliness until the time of our departure, the service are exceptional!! The front office and concierge team are very helpful. Thanks for making this stay memorable.."
"Baur au Lac",,"On the lake, very lush, with great staff","The Baur au Lac is chic, but not too chic - there are a few tourgroups here. Our deluxe room was small and would have annoyed us if it wasn't for one night only. The indoor lounge is pleasant for lunch or drinks, the outdoor dining outstanding fun looking at the garden and the lake if you have booked before - but the service is slow...."
"Baur au Lac",,"Top Three Hotels Ever!","We were back in Zurich at at the Baur au Lac on Holiday for five nights as part of a 3 week vacation and the suite was lovely! We arrived in early after nearly 24 hours of exhausting travel. Just like last time, reception welcomed us warmly and placed us in a suite to rest in while we waited for ours to become available! We had a one bedroom city facing suite which had recently been upgraded and it was spotless and beautiful. Room service is served ""old school"": as an example the soup is delivered in a silver tureen with matching ladle. Loved our entire stay- except for the rainy weather. A little disappointed but still had a great time. The Baur Au Lau special blend 1844 hot chocolate is the best hot chocolate and a real treat and shouldn't be missed. The flower arrangements"
"Baur au Lac",,"a bit antiquated but still has a lot of charm","The rooms were old styled but well set up. The service was excellent throughout the hotel but the main event for me was the dinner service at the restaurant. The food was great but the service was what people dream of when visiting hotels."
"Baur au Lac",,"Amasing","Another visit at this amasing hotel in Zürich. Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Rooms are nice with beautiful decor and all in nice colours and materials. Absolutely beautiful! And what a breakfast!!! Could sit there the whole day and look into the amasing garden."
"Baur au Lac",,"I missed the Spa","When I have checked in it was the first disappointment. They had my reservation but with the wrong name and contact details, it took a long time to change this. Wifi was not working immediately only after I handed my phone to the lady at reception who had to log me in via a different URL. I found this kind of strange, especially when she told me that if the log in doesn't work with my lap top I should bring he lap top down to reception in order to be logged in. Since I stayed there by myself for 2 days , I missed the spa on the second day, because it got kind of boring. The terrace/garden outside is very nice, and if you like a hotel close to the city center and to the lake Zurich this is probably a good one. Rooms in standard category are nice."
"Baur au Lac",,"Very good stay.","The rooms had been refurbished since my last stay here 3-4 years ago. Staff were friendly, efficient and helpful. It was a huge plus to have the garden terrace to enjoy the early summer sunshine, smoke my cigars and entertained clients. The biggest surprise however was the spectacular doubles story gym with a great view of the lake. Good equipment, and well spaced out. It even has a Concept 2 rowing machine. A very good stay."
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent","An excellent traditional hotel right across the beautiful Lac of Zurich. Old , yet fully renovated, classy and comfortable. Staff extremely helpful, smily and courteous.Breakfast is nice but rather basic. Highly recommended."
"Baur au Lac",,"Possibly the best city hotel in the world?","Outstanding location Outstanding service Outstanding accommodation Outstanding food Is this the best city hotel in the world....quite possibly! We have had the pleasure of staying in this grand hotel a number of times and it never disappoints. "
"Baur au Lac",,"An incredible Experience","My wife and I spent three days in this wonderful hotel. The environment is everything one would expect from a five star hotel. What makes the experience truly unforgettable is the staff. Every person we came into contact with from the doorman to the concierge to the maids was consummately professional but also friendly and open. There was no stuffiness or haughty behavior. We were so comfortable it was a shame to leave "
"Baur au Lac",,"Best 5 star hotel","We had been traveling throughout Switzerland and this was by far the best hotel we stayed at. Comfortable, clean, happy and kind staff plus it is centrally located. Room service was the best we’ve ever had anywhere. A little side note that is minor but we really appreciated not being charged for anything in the minibar. We will definitely be referring this hotel to anyone traveling to Zürich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Stellar Staff","From the moment of check-in to our departure after 3-nights stay, every single one we encountered in this beautiful hotel extended a warm, skillful, sincere and caring service. They were engaging but unobtrusive, solicitous but professional. The dining room was opulent and elegant and the grounds of the hotel was beautiful to behold."
"Baur au Lac",,"Junior Suite very comfortable","Four days in Zurich and we have a junior suite on fourth floor. Very comfortable and surprisingly large and a joy after flying from SFO. Bathroom well laid out, twin sinks and heated floors. One block from lake and spectacular grounds and adjacent to old city. Concierge’s very attentive and knowledgeable. Only 30 minutes from airport also. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Best place to stay in Zurich","This is a very traditional Zurich hotel where all details are taken care of to thedetails that you will only find in Switzerland. Every part of the hotel is in perfect condition and in its old style. You some time feel like a guest there in the 20´s. Service is impeccable from the minute you drive up in front of the Hotel. Rooms are great, restaurant is great - both for breakfast and lunch - and on the other side of the building, a bar and restaurant for the evenings. Location is also perfect, close to the center of the city and Bahnhof strasse where you would like to do your shopping!"
"Baur au Lac",,"beautiful area and location","one of the best hotel in Europe i should say, nice rooms beautiful lobby as well as the location and excellent services. one of the best restaurant in Zurich with one Michelin Star. I recommend the out door bar and lobby specially during the spring and summer."
"Baur au Lac",,"Afternoon tea. Quite special.","On this occasion we ordered the 'prestige' tea which comes with a glass of champagne to start with. One generally selects two types of tea from a selection of around twenty varieties which the staff will assist with the selection of if necessary. Small but tasty cakes and various finger size sandwiches are served with fruit scones, clotted cream and jams. This time we decided to try the caviar canapes, which were delicious at chf 24 each, so fortunately we were already quite full. Footnote: We don't stay here as we have a son living nearby."
"Baur au Lac",,"Skip the Rive Gauche","Amazing hotel. Very disappointing Rive Gauche restaurant. Should not be part of the hotel. Not sure how old the Australian steak was that I was served. Shockingly awful experience. The Pavillion restaurant on the other hand is world class. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful!!","Great 2 nights in Zurich! Hotel is beyond your expectations!! From the time we arrived to departure the hotel staff was amazing. Wonderful room service. All of the hotel is so well cared for and clean! I lost my heel of my boot on the cobblestone in town and the concierge had it repaired and returned in less than 4 hours."
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful hotel with a rich history","Everything here is about super high quality, gravity and rich history. The atmosphere might even feel a bit stuffy... But there’s a good pretty modern-style steak house here, where you can relax and stop feeling like you have to live up to high standards. It might not be the ideal location if you are in Zurich for shopping, but all main shopping spots are still within the walking distance. You can’t find a better location in terms of beautiful surroundings though. The hotel is situated right on the lake and offers amazing views from the rooms."
"Baur au Lac",,"Exceptionally fine hostellerie","The Bar au Lac more than deserves its august reputation; it is truly an outstanding hotel. Rooms are deeply comfortable, and beautifully furnished with original art. I was just as impressed with how friendly and knowledgeable the staff were, in particular the concierges. I had not stayed here for several years, and was sadly only here on a short business trip, but was made to feel like an appreciated returning guest. Wonderful experience!"
"Baur au Lac",,"2nd time around...","...And it’s just as beautiful, and provides the high level service one would expect from a 5 star property. Consistently. The hard product matches up to the supreme hospitality one receives. You’re really missing out if you skip over this hotel experience. Can’t wait to be back again. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Baur au Lac Zürich","Was a little treat for my wife’s upcoming birthday and I can say that was the best treat in our 11 years of marriage. We felt like in a fairytale and we were treated extremely well. Looking forward for our next Baur au Lac experience 👍🏻🍾"
"Baur au Lac",,"Nice hotel in a convenient location","Baur Au Lac was a great place for our three night stay in Zurich during Christmas. The decor is very authentic and the hotel is conveniently located on their main shopping street and in a very close proximity to the historic centre. In the begining I was deciding between Baur au Lac, Widder hotel, The Dolder Grand and Storchen and I was glad that I picked BAL in the end. We ended up visiting and dining at The Dolder, which was located pretty far from the centre, however, the view of Zurich was great. While having breakfast at Storchen was a very unpleasant experience when the service was rude and the food wasn’t good at all. I’d gladly return to BAL in the future."
"Baur au Lac",,"24 hours in Zurich","Room old fashioned and in need of a serious revamp. Very nosy room overlooking the street. Needs a double glazing system. Did not sleep very well. Breakfast very average and very expensive. Very disappointing view onto a building site on the right..."

"Baur au Lac",,"Breakfast for a 5 stars Hotel😱🤮","HHHHHOOOOORRRRRIIIIBBBBBLLLLE breakfast , not at the level that you suppose to expect for this type of hotel...what a shame....so this is what we order à la carte 2 plates of smoke salmon with brown toast . 1 plate of mix fruit . At the beginning we received a small sandwich with white toast (wewere so shocked ) and after this is what we received ( pictures). No words to explain our disappointment."
"Baur au Lac",,"Deluxe Oasis","Once you enter the Baur au Lac you find yourself in a different world. This oasis in the heart of Zurich lets you forget the busy hassle of the shopping and business district. Its unique location paired with highly professional service - this is the place to stay when enjoying the beauty of Zurich with its lake!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Service Above and Beyond","My wife and I were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary in Zurich and I contacted the Baur au Lac to secure a reservation for Afternoon Tea Service at the recommendations of friends. Sonia at the Baur au Lac sent an engaging confirmation to my request and on our arrival for tea, Christian, greeted us honored guests. Our 20th anniversary was noted by the staff and while the tea service treats were exceptional, Christian brought us a special traditional desert to celebrate our anniversary. The attention to detail by the management and staff was clear and the Baur au Lac rightly holds a first rate in understanding and delivering exceptional customer service. We were touched by the staff and management acknowledgement of our marriage milestone."
"Baur au Lac",,"Best experience ever","The hotel staff was amazing... The room was majestic. Got engaged to my girlfriend during my stay. From the booking process until check out I couldn't ask for anything more. Big shout out to Stephanie in reservations... She made our stay memorable. "
"Baur au Lac",,"I would give it ten stars!","The service here is beyond believe with it's friendly, welcoming and sometimes quite funny staff at the front desk and door. Our room was amazing and so large that it had two room numbers for one room. Huge bathroom, multiple televisions, seating area, walk in closet and a comfortable bed. What more could you want. They also have excellent restaurants and are located directly across the street from the lake. It is without a doubt the nicest place to stay if it is within your budget. I almost forgot to mention that they have someone that spins the revolving door for you when you enter so that you don't have to touch it. As I said, I would give them ten stars if I could."
"Baur au Lac",,"Afternoon Tea","Afternoon teas are mostly about food these days. Not here at Baur au Lac where tea is the main event. The friendly and very professional waiter suggested switching tea types several times during the afternoon. This was a good procedure: The menu lists two pages of fabulous TWG teas to choose from. No tea bags used here but proper infusers filled with generous helpings of loose tea. Even an hourglass to define the proper time for removing the infusers. Food is unlimited in quantity but limited in selection: Three different finger sandwiches (surprisingly no cucumber, not that I missed them), scones and three different sweets. Quality was top notch except for the macarons which were too hard outside and greasy inside. What a pity, superb macarons are fairly easy to source when"
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful Hotel and Room, for a Steep Price","We had a really lovely experience here. Hotel driver met us in baggage claim at Zurich airport (only hotel that apparently is allowed) which facilitated the quickest airport arrival ever. They met my request for a recently renovated room, and the deluxe junior suite was HUGE and decorated well, though my partner commented it looked almost faux luxe like the Horchow mass market luxury brand of furniture in the U.S. However, you could hardly see the lake, and the view of the street and buildings were more prominent. It's a bit of a misrepresentation to up-charge these views when you're really looking at a roof and cars with a small sliver of lake in the distance. Still, they had double paned glass so it was quiet. Gorgeous and HUGE pink marble bathroom. Still, it felt expensive"
"Baur au Lac",,"Wow this place is beautiful","Beautiful place. We stayed in a suite, which was like a studio apartment in size. We had excellent service while staying here. I would definitely recommend if going to Zurich . Centrally located and easy to walk to several places to shop and eat"
"Baur au Lac",,"A Contemporary Classic","The place to stay in Zurich. Weather business or pleasure it is unbeatable. Don’t skip breakfast’s buffet. Very cosy atmosphere. Although the classic place to stay, it keeps updating constantly so as to be a contemporary hotel. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Horrible service on breakfasts","Our family stayed at Baur Au Lac for 1 night in December. Considering the room prices we expected the high quality standards and services of a 5 star hotel. All the booked rooms were nice, but what we got disappointed about - is breakfast serving. There were many students among the personnel, who do not meet the requirements of a waiter in a 5* hotel restaurant. They couldn't remember the order, they don't know menu details. We had to wait our breakfast (a coffee, toast and cereals) for 40 minutes, and we got it only after an argument with restaurants management. The rooms prices are not cheap, but the service is horrible, that a shame."
"Baur au Lac",,"Such as at Home !","On Nov.30, Staying at “Baur au Lac” 5 star hotel since 1844 in Zurich, Switzerland with the Michelin star restaurant, “Pavillon” - French food and Rive Gauche - modern cuisine and the sophisticated Bar. I enjoyed the special dinner by Nobu Matsuhisa, the very famous Japanese chef. Wonderful Japanese dinner with good wine & nice jazz music and good service by customer-facing employees. They welcomed the guests by “ Irasshaimase〜” in Japanese meeting “ Welcome! “. All staffs are very friendly with good hospitality. They have a reputation for being polite to customers. I felt they love this hotel. After dinner, I enjoyed Martini, my favorite cocktail at the bar to enjoy looking at the people walking on the Bahnhof street. The hotel has a lot of beautiful flowers decorated by"
"Baur au Lac",,"Disappointing service at Baur au Lac Lounge","A colleague and me visited the Baur au Lac Lounge to have a business meeting. After waiting 45 minutes without being served, we were served reluctantly even after walking to a waiter and asking him for service. He literally told us that ""actually we are full"" as an answer to our request, EVEN AFTER SITTING THERE FOR 45 MINUTES!!! After we finished our first round of drinks, we waited again for more than one hour until a waiter approached us to ask us for another wish. We really felt not welcomed in a the noisy atmosphere lacking the necessary level of privacy. We will definitely not visit Baur au Lac again in near future."
"Baur au Lac",,"The best hotel ever","It's my second stay here, and I was as impressed as last time. Everything was perfect. The staff that helped with our luggage, the check-in staff, the housekeeping, everybody was friendly and efficient. The room was perfect, spacious, quiet, beautifully decorated. I just can't wait to return, I was truly impressed! Many thanks and congratulations!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Stunning Hotel in a Stunning Location","Our weekend at Baur au Lac was an absolute delight. A beautiful property in a beautiful location with professional and charming staff in every department, I could not recommend Baur au Lac more highly. The public areas are stunning and the dining options are world class. Any visit to Zurich would be enhanced by a stay at this lovely hotel."
"Baur au Lac",,"Grandeur on the Lake","The Baur au Lac is considered one of the best hotels in the world which is one of the reasons I chose it for my family's Thanksgiving break. Very expensive, no spa, pool, or fitness center. The lake was barely visible and across from a busy street. The breakfast which was 50 swiss francs per person was worth about 10. My soft boiled eggs were completely under cooked and raw. This is a 5 star property and that is not acceptable. The staff was very gracious and competent and the building was beautiful. It was not worth the price. Free mini bar was a nice touch."
"Baur au Lac",,"Old World Charm & Modern Luxury","I love this beautiful property. There is so much love and beauty not to mention history that make up this unique hotel in the heart of Zurich. Immaculate rooms , unparalleled service and delicious dining. Thank you Baur au Lac for a most memorable stay. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Exquisite in so many ways...","Stunning location between the lake and the main shopping sector. Walking distance to everything. Elegant and refined, showing historical value. The most beautiful garden in central zurich, and certainly the most picturesque setting."
"Baur au Lac",,"Not as good as the 1st time","Let me start By saying this is a GORGEOUS property (the pricetag reflects this)& the bellmen are some of the Best in the world. The 1st time I came here I stayed in a lake view suite. It was absolutely stunning and the amenities were on point. On this visit I am on a business budget so I booked The lower end room which is still $600. Since I spent so much much money the 1st visit I figured the front desk staff would at least upgrade me one level. They didn't. They told me they dont do upgrades which I know is not true. The small Room that I am in is quite nice but I definitely wouldn't spend this much money to stay here without any perks or a view. The room stayed VERY warm (like O'Hare airport in the winter warm) even with having the air on at max. I had to open the door to"
"Baur au Lac",,"Elegant hotel in a great location","I recently stayed at the Baur Au Lac during a business trip to Zurich. Pros: - the hotel sits probaly in the best location in Zurich. Just near the business district and off the Bahnofstrasse, right next door to the lake. You can pretty much walk to just about everywhere in the heart of Zurich. - the check in and check out was swift and efficient. - the rooms were tastefully done up and the bathrooms were good too, with all modern amentities. Cons: - i found the size of the rooms a bit cramped, even for Zurich standard. Was difficult moving around and struggling to find a place to keep the bags. - again, no coffee/tea facility in-room which is a pity. Its not always easy to order room service at inconvenient hours. Net net, great hotel in the best possible location. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Treated like a king in luxury!","After two weeks of traveling throughout BEAUTIFUL Switzerland by train it was time to fly home from Zürich. We spent the last night at this fabulous hotel being pampered by the staff in luxury with luxurious accommodations! If you’re looking for the best and money isn’t a concern you won’t go wrong at the Bauer au Lac!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Not just a hotel, it's a destination!","The Baur au Lac is a beautiful hotel with top-notch staff and great rooms. The hotel is huge. I was there for work and stayed a few days and had yet to really visit all of the rooms and such. The main gathering room on the first floor was a cozy spot for some bubbles on in my case, a hot chocolate that was amazing. My room was super clean. One day, I was about to just head to the room and I stopped to enjoy the outside park. It's a nice way to end the day. The hotel is within walking distance to the river and to some great shopping along the Bahnhofstrasse and to the rail station. The concierge team is the best. You name it and they can help you with it. I loved the bit of goodies and the lovely note that welcomed me. There are many who say the hotel needs a remodel or new"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great location true 5 star hotel with service to match.","There are less and less really 5 star hotels in the world but Baur au Lac definitely fits the bill. The level of service is very high and the staff are efficient , friendly and get on with their jobs quietly with no fuss. We had a nice round room with a balcony on the first floor which was comfortable and we slept really well in the bed there. The bathroom was on the small side with only one sink but the shower was great with excellent water pressure. Do go for a walk in the garden leading towards the lake and it is easy to get there as well as to all the high end shops on the Bahnhofstrasse. The only false notes were that the breakfast buffet was somewhat average and the quality of the rolls / bread was not fantastic and in the bar which is not particularly gemütlich when we"
"Baur au Lac",,"The best of the best","Although only there for a short stay, we had an amazing time at the Baur au Lac.

The rooms and restaurants are exquisite, and each and every member of the staff was friendly, knowledgeable and so accommodating. We cannot wait to return!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Nice hotel, very nice staff","The hotel is a bit dated and the room could have been cleaner. There were stains on the carpet, the bench at the end of the bed, and the bathroom floor. We had a nice balcony on the river, facing an office building, so our morning coffee was visible by a hundred people or so. The staff was very welcoming and accommodating, and breakfast was delicious with a beautiful courtyard view."

"Baur au Lac",,"Superb Hotel","We recently had a company meeting at the Baur au Lac. The staff, food, level of service and venue was beyond superior. Every aspect of our stay was fantastic mainly due to the staff and general manager. They are exceptional at their jobs and l commend them."
"Baur au Lac",,"Not all I hoped it to be","Let me start by saying the staff was friendly. The outside restaurant was lovely. The location was nice. I requested a room with courtyard views. I was given a room with a view of a building. I had to keep my shades down especially in the bathroom so the people in the buildings across from me wouldn’t look in. This made the room even darker then it was. The room was so small. I requested a coffee machine in my room. They had no place to put it, so they left it on a wheeled in table. This made for even less room. It was extremely hot out so I went down to the inside bar for a cocktail. It was so hot in the bar area that I told the waitress, I couldn’t stay for another cocktail that it was too hot in here. She said I know it’s really hot. I had to go back to my room where I was"
"Baur au Lac",,"This is not a luxury hotel unless you can stay in a junior suite","The service is excellent. The chocolates which are delivered when you arrive are superb and Kumar even found me a few extra. The refrigerator is stocked with beer and soda and it is free but there is no coffee maker in the room. There is a Toto type toilet . The deluxe room which is advertised as being able to service three people is really only sufficient to service 1. There is no place to even put a tray with coffee in the room because the room is so small . There is no place for your suitcases either. There is barely room to move without bumping into the furniture. A room of about 30 sq meters including a bathroom and hallway is not luxury ! If you cannot afford the junior suite or one is not available and you are traveling with two persons do not go here. The deluxe room"
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury hotel in convenient location.","Service was excellent. Location (not quite on the water) was great. Unfortunately, not all management is familiar with room locations. I asked for a quiet room and was told by a manager that the room on the street side would be quiet as its location was on the 4th floor. Couldn't have been noisier with loud engines repeatedly revving at the stoplight beneath my room until late at night. I was aware of prior reviewers' tips to ask for an interior view room for quietness, but this manager assured me of my quiet location. Plus, the room was available earlier than the standard check-in time. After much complaining throughout the night and the following morning, I was relocated to the interior view room. But the manager was unaware of this room being quieter. It took one of his"
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful hotel, central city","A magnificent hotel with excellent service. The hotel is right off the lake (a one block walk), and an easy walk to anything in the city center. The 'old town' is about a 8-10 minute walk. The breakfast is in a charming salon with both a small buffet and table service. Although there is an indoor bar, I preferred the outdoor bar which overlooks their gardens (which, when I was there, included a sculpture exhibit). The rooms are quite large, and the beds are extremely comfortable. The rooms are also very quiet."

The concierge was very helpful with dinner reservations and sightseeing itineraries. We always book 2 rooms, one for our teen daughters and an upgraded one for ourselves. The girls room was nice and a typical size for Europe. Our suite was a very large open room with separate sitting area. It was quiet on the side without the street and we had an excellent stay."

"Baur au Lac",,"Still Perfect","I just completed a week long stay at the Baur au Lac and it was perfect, as always. What makes it my favorite hotel is the staff, which has very little turnover. I arrived after a delayed over night flight from NYC and my stay got off to a great start when Hans opened the car door and warmly greeted me by name. He runs the front of the hotel flawlessly and seems to know the name of every single guest. The concierge staff is wonderful and they have a lot of pull in Zurich. That is the second trip in a row where they managed to get me a great table in a fully booked restaurant. The Baur au Lac is luxury without the pretentiousness that often comes with it in other hotels. I feel like I am staying among friends."
"Baur au Lac",,"Gorgeous, Beautiful, Amazing, Great Service - Slightly Preferred Dolder b/c of the Spa & Hilltop Views","I stayed at both Dolder and Baur au Lac in the same trip and I preferred Dolder. They're both incredible hotels with friendly, helpful staff and great food, but the modern spa wing and breathtaking hilltop views of Zurich gave Dolder the edge for me. I do think Baur au Lac has the most beautiful restaurant (Le Pavillon) and the afternoon tea area is also quite gorgeous. I will say Dolder generally appears to have smaller rooms - my Baur au Lac single room was around the same size as a double room in Dolder's spa wing (this may be different outside of the spa wing). I was also annoyed that my BAL key had a giant keychain - it barely fit in my smaller handbags. Dolder gives you a normal key card. Bathrooms were similarly spacious, but Dolder had far more counter space with"
"Baur au Lac",,"Perfect location, great service","We stayed in two connecting rooms on a family vacation and enjoyed every minute. The service was great - especially in-room dining, who brought in food for us from outside of the hotel due to our family's food restrictions. The location one block from the lake is perfect for sightseeing, and the views are amazing. We enjoyed watching Switzerland play in the World Cup from the outdoor bar and the surrounding gardens. Great overall and we would definitely stay there again."
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful Service","This is one of the real luxury hotels in Europe. The location basically on Lake Zurich is splendid, the level of service they provide and how they respond to requests is wonderful, the food is delicious and the hotel has all the necessary frills. I had a wonderful spacious suite which was lake front. It had everything a luxury room should have and when requested, the housekeeping staff properly supplied the bathroom each and every time.The closet space is ok, but not expansive. The concierge staff is very helpful, and check in was thorough and easy. I am usually very detailed in my reviews, but the Baur au Lac has everything you will need, they have pretty much thought of everything to make your visit comfortable and they are very proud of their excellent service, as they"

"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic Hotel! Perfect Location!","We stayed at the Hotel in June 2018, in the Junior Suite, for 3 nights. The location is excellent, a two minute walk to the Lake on one side, and to the main shopping district on the other side! The Hotel has its own private lawn, which is excellent (especially in good weather) in the evenings to enjoy drinks & dinner and to just laze! The Room was good & very comfortable! In-room dining had Indian food on its menu, a big plus for Indian travellers craving some. The Concierge at the time of our check-out was extremely helpful & we can't thank him enough (unfortunately, I don't recall his name). My 6 year old daughter had forgotten her fave cap at the Bogner showroom (on Friday evening), by the time we realized that it was too late- the shop was shut including over the weekend"
"Baur au Lac",,"Authetically 5 star","On your last they there, you will not want to leave. This place does not pretend. It IS 5 star luxury. Rooms are luxurious and comfortable. Conveniently located at the north end of Lake Zurich and easy walking distance to the old town. Also located 15 min walk (or 5 min cab ride) to Zurich HB train station for those in need of such transport. Staff waits on your every need - they wouldn't have it any other way. You can leave word/details with the concierge about making any reservations, transportation arrangements, etc and simply trust and know that they will be executed with absolute perfection and professionalism. Restaurants run by Michelin star chef. Food is positively heavenly at all times of day and they have an extremely impressive breakfast buffet. You will not"
"Baur au Lac",,"First Class","We stayed here in June after a long holiday in Europe. It was by far the finest hotel we stayed in during our trip and probably one of our favorites in all our travels. From the moment we arrived, the staff was superb. The room was absolutely beautiful and we wished we would have stayed longer. The bathroom was huge with one of the best showers we have encountered. The location was excellent to the shopping area and the waterfront. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and cannot wait to return."
"Baur au Lac",,"Typically Swiss: Clean, Efficient, & Pricey","If you're in need of a large, well-appointed room on the edge of the shopping area, and have several hundred francs to burn, look no further: this is the hotel for you, and other well-heeled travelers. Lobby was less grand than I anticipated after the fabulous welcome at the door, surrounded by Bugatti's and Mercedes and Benzes, oh my! Breakfast will set you back even more, but then again wait staff is perfectly trained. food excellent, ambiance delightful. We're return-- after we've save up a bit."

Very good breakfast, top notch service by all the crue of the hotel. We are already waiting to come back. Markscheid family."
"Baur au Lac",,"BIG SWISS DISSAPOITNMENT","We visited this hotel when on weekend trip to Zurich. The only pros of this place is the location apart drom that: 1) old uncarred interior 2) small rooms 3) claustrofobic old elevator 4) terrible breakfast with almost no choice of food only some bread with spread, ham and cacao, if tounordered omellet tou wait 30 min for it. The price per bight was almost 800 euros. So for the service we received this price was a bad joke. I felt like in some socialist hotel in russia not a top Swiss hotel. The hotel is just a one big scam for money. Please dont waste tour money in such a horrible ludacris quality."
"Baur au Lac",,"Sublime accommodation in Zurich","My husband and I spent a night here on a recent trip to Zurich. It coincided with our wedding anniversay and the staff went out of their way to spoilt us with a room upgrade, welcome champagne, strawberries and chocolates and a personalised note congratulating us on the occasion. The hotel itself is amazing and felt more like a grand home than hotel. The rooms and facilities are incredible and second to none, no detail is unconsidered. The staff were amazing and the quintessential example of superior service which sets such hotels leaps and bounds beyond the rest. The location too is unparalelled. I can not say enough positive things about our experience and the staff who looked after us at checkin/out, at dinner, at breakfast and lunch. I highly recommend this hotel its a"
"Baur au Lac",,"Gem on the lake","Baur au Lac lives up to its reputation and deserves its #1 ranking on Tripadvisor. It is simply perfect in every way, with splendidly luxurious interiors exuding tasteful elegance. Le Hall in particular is a masterpiece of aesthetic perfection. There is a reasonably large park in the hotel with views of the lake, which had a cute fondue hut and a large gingerbread house set up for the Christmas season. The location is also convenient. It is a little far from the station, but walking distance to both the main shopping district of Bahnhofstrasse as well as Opernplatz across the river, where a large Christmas Market is set up. I was only here for a day, but it was a perfect stay. The rooms are beautifully appointed and tastefully furnished in a distinctive way. Overall, this"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great bar - also for people who live in Zürich","We live and work in Zurich, and tried the bar: Very very good! The cocktails can't be any better (I had a whiskey sour, and ordered another one as it was so good). And the bar staff honestly welcomes you, no matter if you stay at the hotel or just walk in for a drink. In fact, as I have been working in bars in ""my old life"", I was interested to see how the bar keeper organizes his bar, and he took the time to both show and explain everything - really inspiring!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Europe’s finest.","This hotel is not inexpensive but it is one of the finest hotels in Europe. From the minute you check in you are treated like royalty. The amazing staff cannot do enough for you. The rooms are gorgeous, the food and location are fantastic. Don’t miss out on cocktails on the lawn overlooking the lake. This hotel was definitely a treat. Worth the money. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Super luxury","Great rooms and amazing service. Staff was very cooperative. Room had the perfect ambience. Cannot have asked for more. I would say that mid night in room dinning had a bit limited menu but that would hardly be a concern for most of the guests. Very near to the train station so location wise works well if you have to travel to Geneva post a business meeting at this locations. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Super luxury hotel.","We stayed here for 3 nights and it’s located close to the financial district. Our room were very spacious and the bathroom amenities were of top quality. The gym has an amazing view of the lake and also there was gym guide who was very knowledgeable. Had dinner at Pavillion restaurant, a fine dining restaurant within the hotel. Food and service was simply amazing, we were recommended a very good Italian wine by the staff. Overall we had a good stay and my only complain was that we had to go back! "
"Baur au Lac",,"Baur au Lac: a true 5 Star Hotel!","We were recommended to the Baur au Lac when planning our first visit to Zurich. The facility is SUPER! Our room was beautiful and public/restaurants/bars excellent! The location allows walking to many restaurants, lake ferries, Old Town, and the river walk. We really appreciated the Hall Bar and the Pavillon dining. All staff was very helpful and pleasant while professional Concierge and breakfast staff exceptional. I recommend Baur au Lac in Zurich, if your budget permits."

"Baur au Lac",,"Great hotel, great location","We arrived at Baur Au Lac at the end of a two week vacation, having spent a week in Amsterdam and then a week on Rhine River Cruise. We could tell we were in for a treat when we received an email 2 days before our arrival to review our preferences. I reviewed the usual ( king bed, no smoking,etc.) but then had a bit of a special request. We would be coming off of our cruise ship in BAsil at 9 am and were going to arrive at Baur Au Lac by 10:15. I requested early check in but was informed usual check in is at 3 pm. When we arrived at the hotel we were told apologetically the wait would be 15 minutes! In truth, 5 minutes later we were escorted to our room. Other positives:1. The location was wonderful, right across from the lake and the best shopping street; 2. the concierge was"

"Baur au Lac",,"Great Service / Great Location","If you want to be in the heart of the city with a Lake view and great concierge service, this is the place to stay in Zurich. There surely are a few other nice places within the city, but none that combine the location with the 5 star service."
"Baur au Lac",,"Incredible luxury","Dare I say that this is the best Hotel I’ve ever stayed in? Seriously..the best. Even though the hotel was sold out, the management Team upgraded my wife and I to a suite which was absolutely stunning. Check in was absolutely warm and welcoming. The front desk was very attentive to our wants/needs. Luggage reached my room about 2 min after I reached- amazing concierge service. And the room— I won’t post any photos of it because I couldn’t take a photo that would do it the complete justice is deserves. In wall TV, stocked free mini bar, lux couch, Ipad for in room dining/newspapers/Hotel info/pillow service. Huge closet separated by a mini foyer.

"Baur au Lac",,"Classic Hotel in the Heart of Zurich","This may just be the best hotel Zurich. The main appeal of this hotel for my girlfriend and I was its location. The hotel is very well placed, one street over from the bustling Bahnhofstrasse. This means we experienced a peaceful and quiet ambiance, while at the same time not having to walk far to enjoy the shopping and views of the iconic street. Our room was spacious and decorated in a classic way. The bathroom was large and clean. Not much to complain about. That being said, the gorgeous room and amenities made up for it. Next time I'm in Zurich, I will definitely book my stay here."

We were blown away when we arrived at 7am tired after a red-eye that they were able to get our beautiful suite ready within an hour. The comfortable sitting area, the heated bathroom floors and beautiful views made leaving the room a challenge!

"Baur au Lac",,"magnificent hotel","Ive heard many wonderful things about this hotel and they are all true. First off I will say friendliest hotel Ive been in Europe with the most professional approach to the individual tasks. They will try to accommodate anything. The elegance of the interiors are warm and comforting while being grand and stylish.

"Baur au Lac",,"Almost world class New Year Eve stay at Baur au Lac","Baur au Lac New Year Eve We selected Baur au Lac, since they are a member of the Leading Hotels of the World and the location in Zürich. We were offered a junior Suite and we found this room to be excellent in all aspects. The quality and design of this room was of the highest standard. The bathroom tiles were a work of art, such level of details to fit and finish were a sight to be hold – outstanding. The room had a double , two balconies and gave us a direct view of the lake and the alps which were beautiful to behold on a sunny blue sky with the freshly snowed covered alps. This will be important for what happened at midnight in the gardens at Baur au Lac waiting for 2018 to arrive. Read on-... I was really impressed with the Concierge team. Unusual for us but we did"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great located","Location by this hotel is very good indeed. On the main business street generally and near to lake. Warm entree however it looks like 80ties style. Lobby and bar inside of the hotel looks fine and service is pleasant there."
"Baur au Lac",,"Way overpriced","I'm a little surprised by all the glowing reviews of Baur au Lac. While the hotel is perfectly pleasant, I thought it was really hugely overpriced (even considering that Zurich is an expensive city). My room was really quite cramped, and the hotel doesn't even have a pool which you'd sort of expect when you're paying that kind of money. Maybe I just got one of the worst rooms, but I wouldn't stay here again."
"Baur au Lac",,"Sumptuous Comfort","There’s something special about the Baur au Lac. It has maintained a polish and refinement that can only be attained with time and consistent effort—a kind of elegant luster of a bygone era without any of the stuffiness. Built in the mid-19th Century, with fantastic period details and well maintained decor, it still feels fresh and timeless. Just the kind of place I like to retreat to relax. I was only here for a short while this time, but I wanted to remark on my stay and give high marks to the Concierge. They quickly located the taxi where I had left a piece of luggage on my departure and retrieved it. Their responsiveness and level of professionalism is unsurpassed! Additionally, I enjoyed the most fantastic champagne at the Rive Gauche & Bar. They have been purchasing"

"Baur au Lac",,"Absolutely delightful!","After staying at this hotel for five nights I had the opportunity to sample and observe the well trained staff as they handled both delightful, and less than charming customers with ease. The food was delicious, the room as expected was spotless, and the warm and relaxing lounge was a wonderful space to enjoy a drink or meet friends. Special kudos to the chef who on my last two days even managed to make a couple of fabulous chocolate desserts for me that conformed to my allergy requirements. I will gladly return to enjoy this splendid hotel!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Still Excellent","It has been awhile since I stayed at the Baur au Lac, but I spent 2 nights there this week. It is still one of the best hotels in hotels imaginable. They cannot do enough for you. I look forward to my next visit."
"Baur au Lac",,"An amazing hotel in every respect","The Baur-au-Lac is a fantastic hotel that continues to amaze me. It is perfectly situated in the heart of Zurich right near the lake and the shopping and business district. The hotel is a perfect mix of old world service and charm combined with the most modern amenities. The Baur-au-Lac staff is second to none, the staff is incredibly friendly and professional. The concierge staff is like having trusted advisors that can help with just about anything. The Baur-au-Lac is like a home away from home for me and I am already looking forward to my next stay."

"Baur au Lac",,"Brilliant","I was fortunate to stay in the Baur Au Lac. Billed as one of the great hotels of the world and it lives up to that and more. Opulent and luxurious are words that spring to mind when I think of the Baur. The room was superb, the bed and the pillows (there is a choice) were so comfortable - the highest praise I can say is that it felt like I was sleeping in my own bed. There was an issue on check in that I was placed in a room beside the lift which for some would not be a problem but for me was a little too noisy. I requested a quieter room and I was immediately shown to a different room. Facilities in the room were excellent and the shower and bathroom were top class. Everything was spotlessly clean. The hotel is well located in Zurich and basically close to everything. The"

"Baur au Lac",,"a lovely hideaway in the middle of Zurich","Impeccable service, lovely traditional rooms, great location. The Breakfast selection could offer more variety. The eggs Benedict were good, but the yolk just a bit too hard. The coffees were luke warm. Just note currently there is a construction next door, triple paned windows guarantee quiet sleep though."
"Baur au Lac",,"Very comfortable","We stayed here for 2 nights and found the hotel excellent - it’s expensive but the service and attitude 1st class. Rooms and beds very comfortable and the bathroom has an enormous bath plus large seperate shower . The common rooms are elegant and decorated in a clean conservative manner, having comfortable chairs and sofas This is an old school hotel and I defy anyone not to like it. Breakfast is in a superb room where there is plenty of service on hand should you so wish - again this is expensive Note - I’ve stayed at many 5 star hotels and been served maple syrup that isn’t the real Macoy which I find very annoying- here it’s the real deal and excellent quality too"
"Baur au Lac",,"Elegant, stylish, classic five-star hotel","Everything in this hotel is elegant and graceful. The entrance welcomes you with its fine marble floor leading you into the plush lounge. This stunning room, called “Le Hall” has an impressive Empire period chandelier as its centerpiece, porcelain Chinese table lamps and luxurious silk and wool carpets, and lots of comfortable seating; you can enjoy afternoon tea, or a light meal here. The floral decorations in this room are simply sumptuous. The hotel employs two fulltime florists who decorate the hotel with over 1000 flowers every day. I would recommend using the stairs to get to your room, to discover the beautiful stained-glass windows that grace the stairwells. Just like the hotel, the rooms and suites are tastefully decorated combining classical touches with modern"
"Baur au Lac",,"The couple coupled.","I loathe it when my trophy wife is referred to as my 'partner' for it belittles her genius and her decisive role in our family and, indeed, relationship. As the chauvinist in the relationship, my conscience and better part occasionally get the better of me and I take her away for sojourns such as the one we took in the Bower by the Lake, Zurich - not to be confused with the Bowyer by the Lake, a reference to Lee, the orc-like subhuman who once played football and the watery substance into which much of humanity wishes he would cast himself. Now I have had occasion to review the Bower in the past and, whilst I did so in glowing terms, there is no hyperbole that can adequately cover its glory in this review.

But at Baur au Lac it is family run, and it shows. The cuisine at the Terrasse is modern and fitting to the most spectacular garden that faces the lake. The garden has two most magnificent trees, one Japanese Ginko planted over a hundred years ago, and the other is just as impressive. Facing the lake the garden has an art in the park sculpture show until August 4, 2017 - it is awesome. The suite I stayed had the charm and modern luxury with a fantastic shower and bathroom area. The bed is impeccable and the overall impression is grand elegance and luxury in the centre if the city."

"Baur au Lac",,"Simply perfect...","My dad was from Zurich. And as I child we spent our annual leave skiing in the Swiss Alps. Returning from a trip to Paris for New Year’s with my wife and young children I had a severe bout of nostalgia coupled with extreme guilt: I had not yet taken my kids skiing. The long and the short is we booked a trip to Switzerland for late February. We stayed six days at the Kulm in St. Moritz (see separate review) and a day on the way back at the Baur au Lac in Zurich. I’m the first to say that we’re are incredibly fortunate to be able to do these things although we are certainly not price insensitive (see review of Villa d’Este for family bio). We had booked a van to take us from St. Moritz to Zurich and we arrived late morning. The arrival was smooth: Doors were opened,"
"Baur au Lac",,"Truly a wonderful experience","I have stayed at the Baur au Lac for 60 years and it continues to be a wonderful place. Rooms have been updated but retain their old world charm. Service is excellent. Only drawback is the recent construction nearby"
"Baur au Lac",,"Palatial City Hotel","I returned to this property after several years, this time with wife and kids. Our two connecting rooms were quite large and had lots of nice little amenities upon arrival. The rooms were interior but bright. Make sure to turn on the air conditioner for the room to cool off before bedtime. Dinner at their bistro was excellent though pricey (that $200 of Amex credit went real fast here), and breakfast in the pavillion is a beautiful room and we liked the buffet as well as the hot items made to order. The gym here is probably one of the best of the city hotels and has a nice view of the lake. (I was disappointed by the gym at the Park Hyatt.) The bell staff, concierges and valets look after their guests well. Be sure and watch the hotel movie in your room; it is one of the best of"

"
"Baur au Lac",,"Short stay in Zurich","Wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel. Excellent service and very well appointed rooms. The outdoor garden restaurant is an oasis within the city. The location is also excellent for getting to know the city by foot. Will definitely stay there again when in Zurich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury living in Zurich","“This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!! They make you feel like the only guest in the hotel” “Staff were exceptional. Everyone and everything about the Baur au Lac is super. You always feel special , The concierge staff were fantastic."
"Baur au Lac",,"I night","Expensive high class hotel. Excellent location. Superb staff and concierge service. Wonderful breakfast buffet. Would splurge and stay here if only have a short time in zurich. Great dinner recommendation for seafood at local place that supplies their seafood..? Bachlia"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great location for walks around the town","The room was very nice, bathroom fantastic and shower great. Hotel is in a great location and the service was good. The outside bar does shut down quite early about 10 pm, but it was opened up for us a couple of times. Only problem was the construction next door. They did contain the sound in the hotel but outside dining can be very noisy"
"Baur au Lac",,"Bookmark (keep reading!)","There is a little story of my expereince in Baur au Lac that says it all. During my stay there, I left an open book that I was reading on my bed in my room and went out for dinner. While I was away a maid came to turn the bed. She had, of course, to move the book and she put it on the night table. Upon my return, I picked up the book and found a hotel book marker inserted between pages where I finished reading before going out. Hats off to Baur au Lac!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Swiss excellence","Baur au Lac is a dynamic hotel experience in that it is non pretentious luxury with utterly professional standards. it is refined, elegant and comfortable. while offering 5 star service, the staff is very personable and goes above and beyond to offer genuine hospitality of the highest order."
"Baur au Lac",,"I don't want to leave","I love this hotel. The location is wonderful. It overlooks Lake Zurich. Two steps away is access to a boat ride around the lake. A few Blocks away is the main shopping street. And within walking distance is Old Town. The service is excellent! The ambience is lovely. The rooms are very nice, and also very expensive. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Dinner at Pavillion","Fantastic service all around from beginning to end. All of our dishes tasted great, from bouillabaisse, foie gras terrine, pigeon (with truffle sauce and duck liver), turbot (with sturgeon caviar sauce and spring vegetables), beef in BBQ sauce with spaghetti (special cater for children), and petit fours. Personally found it extremely precious to have found a Michelin star restaurant that works above and beyond on servicing their guests to make the whole experience unforgettable. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful Location, Very traditional","This is a place I would visit with my grandparents. It is a very nice and old traditional hotel in Zurich. Right around the corner is another hotel in the same Price category that is a lot more modern and ""hip"", be sure to check out all your options when you visit Zurich lots of smaller Hotels will also be just as good as the big and famous ones."
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing stay at Baur au Lac","We had a lovely time at the Baur au Lac. Everything was perfect and the team was professional and friendly. The concierge team was amazing, without exception, they gave us lots of advice and support. We came to the hotel on the recommendation of a friend back home in Abu Dhabi, and we would most certainly recommend it to others too. Thank you for making us feel special."
"Baur au Lac",,"Engadine Trek","This property and its staff are simply fabulous. Our rooms were A+, the food was outstanding and the staff created a warm, welcoming and relaxed environment for our family of eight. The location is perfect for experiencing Lake Zurich and the sights of the city. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent","Check in was fast and smooth, we booked three rooms and got one room upgraded to a junior suite! The rooms are spacious enough, mixing modern and classic styles. I liked how the classic parts of the rooms didn't seem / smell musty. Also, the modern furniture gave the rooms a clean look. They even provide a tablet that contains all of the necessary information you need about the hotel ( services eg. Pillow section, laundry, concierge..) and about Zurich (weather, places to visit, etc) and much more stuff!! The bathrooms were fabulous, clean and modern enough. About the breakfast, it's delicious!! French toast was perfectly my style and the croissants are fresh. One more thing to mention, the staff is great and friendly!! Only one!! I think she's from the breakfast section"
"Baur au Lac",,"League of Its Own","The Baur Au Lac is the best hotel in Zurich ... and it ought to be given the price! That said, the place is immaculate and the service standards are world class (think Bristol in Paris or Hotel Bel Air in LA). Beds, sheets and towels are at the highest level, and room technology is intuitive and simple to operate. The restaurant is ""Swiss Continental Cuisine"" perfection but there are also interesting surprises like a Middle Eastern menu. The Staff speaks most major languages and the Concierge will get you into to any restaurant."
"Baur au Lac",,"classic","A very classic hotel - historic design and helpful concierge. great location among walking distance to old town and all the shopping. nicely decorated even have a pillow menu. breakfast was not included. thought that was the only downfall."
"Baur au Lac",,"old world charm and super location","The Baur au Lac is a grand dame for sure. well situated on the lake and in walking distance to all that is amazing about this city. the rooms are well appointed and what one would expect from old world with modern updates. the garden bar is super for afternoon drinks or lunch."

"Baur au Lac",,"Magical","From our arrival to departure, there was nothing that was too much for this hotel. The hotel team was warm, friendly and efficient from every level. Concierge suggested a quick 1 hour tour around the local area and it was easy to find on the map he gave us. The service in the restaurant was friendly and efficient - nothing was ever too much trouble. The check-in/out was fast and efficient. There was even an art display in the gardens which so refreshing to experience and thus you can truly say this was a luxury 5 star experience. THANK YOU TO ALL THE TEAM - we will be back!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Beauty in Zurich","We only stayed one night at Baur au Lac but it truly is a 5 star hotel all around from beautifully decorated rooms, friendly and helpful staff, to delicious breakfast buffet. Location of the hotel is ideal to walk to old town. We will be back!!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Another Example of Swiss Perfection","We only stayed one night--but wish we had stayed longer. This is not the Hotel for the everyday traveller--unless you have an unlimited budget. That said, the prices should not discourage any visitor. You clearly get what you pay for. We were greeted by smiling and polite staff throughout our stay. The Concierge staff was exceptional. We had a minor incident upon our arrival where the female reception desk employee was rather unpleasant. She, like us, had apparently had a bad day (ours due to a travel mix-up) and was short and impatient. When I mentioned it to the more Senior Reception Manager, immediate apologies were offered as well as some outstanding Swiss chocolates. Enough said--problems are often incurred, but the measure of satisfaction comes in how they are"
"Baur au Lac",,"Afternoon Tea treat","We booked into the Hall for afternoon tea as a treat whilst we were staying for a few days in Zurich. WE have had afternoon tea in a number of hotels all over the world and this was very good indeed. The room is quite stunning and the service was very good but the room felt a little lifeless as there was only us and one other couple in at the time. There is unlimited tea and coffee included and you get another plate of sandwich and scones if you want. Being gluten intolerant they did cater well and it was most enjoyable but not cheap by any stretch of the imagination. 159CHF for 2 with one beer and one water."
"Baur au Lac",,"Fabulous Stay","Booked this hotel for a special birthday break for my wife in June . Everything from arrival greeting to the room , food & drinks absolutely First Class . Have no hesitation Highly recommending a stay here to any of our friends . Will be returning hopefully in September"
"Baur au Lac",,"An almost perfect stay. Still the best, but needs to address their breakfast service IMMEDIATELY","The Baur is such a wonderful hotel and I look forward to my yearly visit very much. Room was lovely. Desk staff and concierge were fantastic. It really is a heavenly place to stay. Rive Gauche, the terrace cafe, was so outstanding. During my stay, was there for lunch, dinner and drinks on different days. Perfect setting and wonderful staff. Was absolutely perfection. What happened in the Pavilion for breakfast, however, was an unmitigated disaster. On a daily basis, I do not spoil myself with an indulgent breakfast. But when at the Baur, it is something I look forward to. How disappointed was I! After being seated hastily, and our hot beverage orders taken, we were neglected completely. No one ever came with a menu. Maybe we were in the mood for some lovely eggs"
"Baur au Lac",,"ART IN THE PARK","Zurich is a great city and Switzerland is wonderful. I have stayed in the best hotels around the world and this was amongst the finest. Service was unmatched. But for me the location and especially the rooms were exceptional. Thank you Baur Au Lac"
"Baur au Lac",,"Top Hotel in Zurich","Still one of the best hotel in Zürich. Close to the Zürich lake and the main shopping area. It has a great garden. Rooms are good but not sure it worth €600+ A night. FIFA executives love to stay here "
"Baur au Lac",,"Splendor on the Lake","This is a beautiful hotel situated right near Lake Zürich. The service is as good as any we have ever experienced if not better. Everyone was wonderful. Our suite was gorgeous and the food spectacular. Don't miss trying the Pavillion for dinner. We had a wonderful tour of the area in the Rolls Royce hosted by Josef from the hotel. It was great. I high;y recommend this property. You will love it."
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent Hotel!","This is second time we have stayed at this wonderful hotel and I would very highly recommend it. It is expensive - but the place is beautifully run. The location is very central - located right by the lake and a 5 minute walk to the shopping street as well as the old town. The rooms are beautifully and very luxuriously decorated and well designed. The hotel also has its own garden - perfect for sitting outdoors on a summer's evening."
"Baur au Lac",,"Fabulous Stay","What a fabulous hotel! Everything was perfect -- the room was spacious as was the bathroom. The staff was perfect and every detail was done just right! We totally enjoyed our stay. Well worth the splurge!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Worth it","Well, what be said? Excellent location - 5 minutes walk from the Old town, right on the lake. Wonderful service. Luxurious rooms with everything needed. Whatever you ask for is done in no time. To put it into a nutshell - 5 stars hotel in its best notion. Not cheap at all, as well as Zurich itself. But quality for money ratio is almost perfect."
"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic hotel, but very expensive","This is the most exclusive hotel in Zürich, but probably also one of the most expensive. Very nice rooms, attentive staff. Very service minded. Perfect for a romantic holiday or if you have deep pockets and want the best hotel in Zürich "
"Baur au Lac",,"All Rounded Michelin Restaurant","We have only 2 short days in Zurich, the weather was impeccable and the beautiful surroundings make our times rather tight, we still find times to indulge in Michelin Star meal. Baur au Lac's or Pavillion Zurich continue to earn 1 Star for 2017, in addition they hold 18 MilauGault points in Switzerland...so we decided to lunch here, it was another great experience to have. We reached the restaurant at about 11.50am while they just about getting ready to open door, I told the gentleman (kind of restaurant manager or supervisor) that I have only one hour or so for lunch and asked for his help, as French meal usually took much longer. He immediately assured me not to worry about it and just enjoy the lunch, will be done in one hour etc. We were led to our table just about at 12, we"
"Baur au Lac",,"Simply one of the best hotels in the world","The hotel more than exceeded its lofty reputation. We were upgraded to premier rooms which were exquisitely furnished, spotlessly clean and with all the modern technologies. Public rooms & restaurants were also spectacular. However, even better than the facilities was the service. Some of the reviews was that service was sometimes a little ""snooty"". What we saw was extremely friendly and helpful at every touch point. The valets had cars available in no time (sparkling clean); concierge got our party of 8 reservations on 15 minutes notice at one of the top Zurich restaurants; check in & check out was extremely prompt and even the housekeeping staff smiled and asked how they could help at all times. Yes, the hotel is expensive but if you want a very special experience well"
"Baur au Lac",,"Incredibile","The Baur au lake overlooking the lake is the grandest of the old palace hotels. The room has been given contemporary twists oversized photographs and original art works swirly carpets and padded leather headboard for the bed. The lobby bar and the light flooded Pavillon restaurant are glorious. The brand-new restaurant Rive Gauche just off the main bar is contemporary and cool. Amazing service "
"Baur au Lac",,"Best place to stay in Zurich","I like Zurich I travel there quite often, so I stayed in many hotels in Zurich. But during the last three visits I have been staying in Baur Au Lac, and I can say that it is the best place to stay. The service is impeccable. From the moment you enter the hotel until the moment you check out everything is perfect: service, rooms, quality of food. I can really recommend it to those people who value 5star service. Concerning the hotel building: it is a beautiful renovated building, with a small park by the lake. It's very close to the city center and the shopping area. The rooms are nicely decorated and spacious. I can say that my stay there was perfect."
"Baur au Lac",,"Understated Stellar","There is type of Swiss understatement that i find unique: being stellar and reliable without any need of showing off. No Swiss institution embodies this virtue more than Baur-au-Lac. As long as I can travel, I will recommend and return to this marvelous hotel."
"Baur au Lac",,"Classic","This is definitely a classic. Unfortunately, rooms enjoy a very limited view. Most of a inside, ""industrial"" courtyard or of surroundings by buildings. If you choose a room, get one overlooking the creek. Service is old school excellent, arguably the best in Zurich. The food is ok, pavilion restaurant is very well versed in culinary technique. Front desk and bell boys: perfect Room service: good Laundry: good Club sandwich index: 4/10"
"Baur au Lac",,"The Quintessential Five Star Experience","This is a beautiful property with an elegant decor. From the moment I arrived at the property, the members of the staff were extremely attentive and accommodating. Throughout my stay, the service was impeccable. My room was absolutely lovely and very comfortable, although a bit small. It was elegantly appointed and the layout optimized every inch of the relatively small space. The location is perfect. It's a short walk from Lake Zurich, a beautiful lake with a picturesque shoreline filled with activity. A few minutes walk in another direction and you find yourself amid exquisite shopping and an impressive restaurant district. My only regret is that my stay was so short."
"Baur au Lac",,"This is an eleven!","If you are spending any time at all in Zurich, this should be your spot. From the outside arrival to the final wave goodbye, every interaction with the staff does not disappoint. And the rooms and amenities are all you ever want in a fine hotel. The concierge and the staff anticipate almost every want or need, and make things happen effortlessly. Directions, restaurant recommendations, and help with a medicine prescription all took just minutes, and worked out amazingly well. I don't usually ""gush"", but the Baur au Lac delivers."
"Baur au Lac",,"Disappointing","My main disappointment with Baur au Lac is that I'd booked from seeing pictures of the Pavilion & accompanying terrace. The Pavilion was closed during my stay and the terrace un-serviced. It's also a hotel you have to get used to as all the doors are unmarked and you have to get an idea where everything is or keep on asking. It is a convenient city centre hotel and the other restaurant, Rive Gauche is outstanding. The room was pleasant enough although after the other hotels it was much smaller and I missed the views as the room looked out on a small court yard. As I was staying mid week the other guests seemed to be business orientated which it would suit more than for the holiday destination I had hoped. Everything was generally efficient, polite & courteous as expected from a"
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury and excellent service","We spent one night at the hotel which is indeed very nice and has a very profesional concierge. We appreciated the welcome chocolate in our room and the very nice room and bathroom. Breakfast offer can be improved. We were a little upset because we asked to have a room with a lake view but this was not the case.👍👍🏼👍"
"Baur au Lac",,"My February stay","This hotel was excellent. The ambiance and the rooms are beautiful. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. I had to leave at 5:30am to make the train and they even prepared breakfast for me to take along. They were professional and helpful with everything I needed. I highly recommend this beautiful hotel."
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing service, luxury rooms, best concierge service ever","We were lucky to stay there for one week and this was a most exquisite hotel experience. The Baur au lac is a brilliant example of the Swiss hospitality perfection. It is very expensive but at least you get what you are paying for. You will find here a great mix of modern equipment and very cosy and classical design. It is nice, cosy, extremely comfortable (beds are cocoons, bathrooms are large with every amenities, lights and plugs everywhere you may need, curtains do close completely, etc, etc). And the place is cleaned and maintained in such a way that it always looks perfect as if you were the first customer to walk in. I doubt any client ever saw a mark or a spot on a wall or on the carpet at the Dolder. In room dining is same quality as the restaurants with a very large"
"Baur au Lac",,"Very Nice","The hotel is located by the lake with beautiful grounds for the guests to enjoy. It is situated just a few minutes from Bahnhofstrasse for shopping enthusiasts. There are lots of restaurants near the hotel. The room decors are beautiful. It's one of the best hotels in Zurich for sure."
"Baur au Lac",,"The best in Zurich Old School Glamour","Baur au Lac exceeded our expectations. A grand dame among the best of the best. The service is superior delux. Exceptional staff, facilities, Dining and location. We went for a low key birthday celebration and the staff made it most memorable. Thank you. We can't wait for an excuse to visit again!"
"Baur au Lac",,"One night in Zurich","Highest Zurich classic. Combination of old time and today. Always keep it's high standarts. The lobby bar has limited spirits. No big deal. No need to say how the hotel is clean. The most important thing for us is that you can smoke in your room."
"Baur au Lac",,"ALL IMPECCABLE EXCEPT.....","Everything in this historic hotel is what you would expect. Beautiful building, impeccable courteous staff and a superb location. What a pity breakfast was such a let down. Went three times during our stay and each time it was the same. No one to greet on arrival, waiting around until someone decided to attend to us. Then when taken into the dining room few tables available, as all that were empty were still to be cleared up from the last users. Timid, inexperienced staff and a limited choice of options both cooked and buffet. We also dined in Rive Gauche a couple of times which was completely the opposite....so those guys really need to explain to the breakfast team how it should be done!!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing tea time at Le Hall","We had the best afternoon tea experience at Le Hall at hotel Baur Au Lac , thanks to the exceptional service of Kristian Panzer he was the best , we are definitely coming back.

"Baur au Lac",,"Elegant lovely hotel with impeccable service","The Baur Au Lac is a grand hotel in the classic tradition. Elegant, with immaculate service delivered perfectly but also with warmth. The rooms are beautiful. The location is lovely. Everything in central Zurich is in walking distance and the lake is out the front door for a run or walk."
"Baur au Lac",,"Superb; not perfect but it'll do...","Stayed for a night on business January 2017. Bedroom (a double) near-perfect, the only major gripe being terribly noisy air conditioning, which came on fitfully during the night and sounded like someone turning on and off a giant hairdryer. The aircon isn't really needed in winter so I'd advise leaving it off, and perhaps staying elsewhere mid-Summer. Other moans: no coffee making facilities in the rooms, and bathroom tissue the texture of baking parchment. Keep all this in context however: rooms are large, beautifully furnished and well sound-proofed. The minibar is complimentary (don't get too excited: no wine or spirits and just two beers) and the bedding is top quality, as are the toiletries. Staff are super-friendly and very welcoming. I didn't dine at the hotel but"
"Baur au Lac",,"Classical elegance","Hard to beat the renowed elegance at this hotel. The service and food leaves nothing to be desired. The lobby had been redesigned and upgraded, a neccessary step to keep up with time maybe, but the old lobby was even more elegant in my opinion."
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful hotel. Best in Zurich","Great location. You can walk anywhere. The service is excellent especially the concierge who can help you arrange anything you need. Breakfast is excellent-fresh croissants and delicious eggs. I won't stay anywhere else."
"Baur au Lac",,"Runs Like a Swiss Watch","Having stayed at the Baur au Lac at least 30 times in the past 30 years, the latest being January 2017, I can safely say that the Baur au Lac runs with the effortless perfection of a fine Swiss watch. Everything, but everything, always works beautifully. The staff can't do enough. The food in its Rive Gauche Restaurant is outstanding, the enormous living room in which it serves tea and drinks is elegantly relaxing. The Christmas decorations, including the huge ginger bread house, were beautiful. I would only add Fox News and Fox Business to its TV channels. CNN is part of the past. Otherwise, this hotel never disappoints."
"Baur au Lac",,"Pesadilla Argentina","Excellent and traditional hotel in Zurich. I have comingo to this hotel since many years and is always excellent. The rooms ar very nice, and quiet. The maidas are very well trained. And the Concierges are Super. They are always at your service. And they are they know Zurich very well"
"Baur au Lac",,"The perfect experience","I have been staying at Baur au Lac regularly for many years. There was never a bad stay. From the happy smile of the doorman to the professional and friendly welcoming by the concierge and the reception staff there is perfection every where. The rooms are comfortable and beautiful. Breakfast is beautifully presented and the only thing missing is the thin slices of cheese which we Swedes prefer. This was later fixed, of course. It is delightful to at least once a year having the perfect hotel experience."
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing hotel, amazing service, amazing experience","This was my first time in Zurich and did not know what to expect. I had booked this hotel after reading a number of reviews which said the hotel was excellent. Upon arriving at the hotel I was not disappointed, this has to be hands down one of the best hotels I have stayed in anywhere. From the moment we arrived the service was great, I can not fault it at all. The views from the hotel are amazing and the transport links are even better. The hotel is a short tram ride away from the main train station, which will connect you to any destination around Zurich. The facilities inside the hotel are also amazing, the restraunt, the room service the massages. There are also a number of restraints around the hotel which provide really flavoursism food. The only disappoint with this"
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent service and very festive at Christmas","Baur au Lac has an excellent location, beautiful rooms, and delicious food, but the service is what makes the experience so memorable. The staff really cares about making your stay special, and everyone we encountered was kind, helpful, and friendly. Try to book a room on the river - it is much quieter than the street side of the hotel, and most of the rooms have balconies along the river. Our room was a generous size, as was the bathroom, and both the room and the bathroom had balconies. Of course, the wonderful and generous breakfast was also a highlight of our stay. The hotel also has beautiful Christmas decorations and was very festively decorated during our late-November stay. I appreciate how much they respect and enjoy the Christmas season; it added so much to our stay."
"Baur au Lac",,"Wow! Its an amazing hotel with perfect location","I loved this hotel the minute i stepped into the lobby. The staff are very professional and helpful. The location was perfect, shopping at your doorstep, and the lake was opposite the hotel, which was beautiful. The room, was luxurious and very comfortable. Even room service was very good. Interestingly, they had a 2 page "" pillow menu"" which i had not come across that before.The room had high tech gadgets, example, ordering room service on the iPad provided in the room. The staff are incredibly attentive, and the hotel is relaxed, luxurious highly organised. Well, it is Switzerland after all. It is an expensive hotel, no doubt about that, but quality and luxury are remembered long after you have paid your credit card bill, so for a memorable experience, I would recommend this"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great Afternoon-Tea at le Hall - EXCELLENT service","We have for the first time tried the afternoon tea at le Hall in the Baur au Lac Hotel Lobby and it was very delicious The food itself is very good as well as the teas offered. The price for the afternoon-tea is not cheap but normal for a five star hotel and the quality of the food is really great - and you can order more at no additional price. However, the best part of the afternoon-tea are the waiters. All of them are very friendly but our waiter was extraordinary competent with the teas and did an excellent job. When you have an afternoon tea or something else at a five star hotel, it usually is always very good but not the service but this time, it was really fantastic. Thank you!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Perfect as usual !!","Enjoyed my stay throughly , everything was perfect from check in to check out. Staff looked after all our requirements and were efficient with our requests. Been staying at Baur for a few years & Cannot wait to return again soon !"
"Baur au Lac",,"Summer Vacation","Beautifully located on Lake Zurich as well as the famous Bahnhofstrasse. A recently renovated hotel that always confirmed the hospitality of its hosts. The best of all were the concierge team members who relentlessly endeavored to make my family's vacation a memorable one. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Classic Luxury at its best","Had a fabulous time at the Baur au lac! Really enjoyed how the classic luxury elements like the kiosk and the concierge desk have stayed. At the same time the hotel has many modern ammenities and a very nice modern restaurant with amazing food. The service is truly exceptional - make sure to request the Rolls Royce airport transfer ;) The rooms are very spacious and combine modern touches with a classic design with white marble bathrooms. Only missed a Nespresso machine in the room and a Spa to relax after a long day work would be nice. Highly recommended."
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury","Amazing hotel nothing bad about it , from front desk all the way to room service are well trained in speaking and treating there guests . You need the money to spend here but once again its a 5 star hotel with all top brands displayed on ground floor. 2 nights here with my wife she loved it . "
"Baur au Lac",,"Great location and wonderful staff","We booked our reservation via our membership with Leading Hotels of the World. We are fond of LHW hotels and enjoy our stays. We are provided LHW amenities in 98% of the properties. Upon arrival we were shown to a courtyard view room which was very comfortable, but not very large. The room amenities were fine. It was quiet and the personnel were very friendly and efficient. The property itself is in a great location. It is steeped in history and ambiance. There are a few different places to dine and the breakfast included with our room was impressive. I was disappointed that some of the benefits of a Leaders Club member were not provided. I expected a bit more than I received. Still it is a nice property and staff. It was the smallest and most expensive room I have"
"Baur au Lac",,"Afternoon tea, at its best!!!","Although living in Switzerland we visited the Baur au Lac for the first time. My mother had her birthday so I wanted to make her a nice gift and invite her in Le Hall to enjoy the Afternoon tea. At the time we entered the Hall, the Manager( Panagiotis) greeted us warmly with a smile in his face and escorted us to the table next to the fireplace. He explained us what is offered in the Afternoon tea and recommended us to try in the end the special hot chocolate( as it is made by actual chocolate peaces and not powder) which was btw delicious . The room was beautifully decorated with colorful flowers , olive trees and vases. The furniture are new and modern with a traditional touch though. We started with a glass of champagne and the waiter came with the food( mini sandwiches with"
"Baur au Lac",,"Bah on the Lake!","Needing to stay in Zurich for just one night, I thought we'd treat ourselves to a nice, classic hotel. Nice and classic it was. Service was ok. Room was tiny. Food was just so-so. All would've been ok if it wasn't just so darned expensive! And on the lake? Bah-bah humbug on the lake. It was by a lagoon, at best. A bit over-rated and most certainly a bit too costly for what one gets."
"Baur au Lac",,"Timeless Charms","The Baur au Lac is one of my favorite hotels in the world! A trip to Zurich or Switzerland for that matter would not be complete without a stay at this fabled and romantic hotel. Please do yourself a favor and treat yourself (and a loved one) to a truly beautiful experience. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent hotel on the lake shore!","I stayed at this hotel back in the 90s, and has honestly do not remember. Many have heard from friends and acquaintances, different and good and bad. Overall, I am very satisfied. Lovely comfortable room. Wonderful service. One thing I would like to mention, better let the mini-bar will be paid, but not so empty."
"Baur au Lac",,"A Classic in Zurich","I stayed only one night and the service and overall quality was impeccable as it was 6-7 years ago when I first stayed there. It was not possible to notice a negative point during my stay. I strongly suggest to enjoy a drink in the garden if the weather is nice."
"Baur au Lac",,"A Great Hotel","One of the best hotels we have ever stayed with. Every staff member was genuine and helpful. After an excellent, but filling lunch, we enjoyed wine and lighter fare in Le Hall. Our server was very knowledgeable on the menu and the wine list. It felt like we were eating at someone's home, not a restaurant. The salads and small plates were superb. The location cannot be beat. We walked along the lake, through the old town and down the main shopping area, all within 10 minutes of the hotel. Our only regret was that we were unable to stay longer."
"Baur au Lac",,"great location, great hotel","Great location, great hotel. rooms are very comfortable, service & staff is perfect. indeed during the period we've stayed there there was a construction near the restaurant. we did have a very noisy breakfast and the other day preffered not to have breakfast in the hotel. Also a catering event which caused some of the hotel facilities out of use for hotel guests .. this should have been mentioned to us before our arrival. We could not see the nice garden since there were preparations ... we could not use the LOBBY on the event night etc... Hotel should not host events like that since I believe their event rooms are not sufficient .."
"Baur au Lac",,"Top of the art","Very beautiful and central hotel in the heart of zurich. I stayed there during 4 days with my family in summer 2016 and had a great time. Personal is very polite, hotel is very clean and has great food. Many amenities in our room. Very happy with this choice."
"Baur au Lac",,"Top of its class","Excellent location, great welcome at the door by Hans, cosy and well decorated rooms. Inner court rooms are absolutely quiet. It is always a pleasure to come back. The staff is wonderful, at the receptions, the concierge, the breakfast restaurant and the staff on the floor."
"Baur au Lac",,"Grand Hotel!","Baur was a great location in the old town with everything within walking distance. the lobby was very beautiful with the bar being a great place for a cocktail before dinner.rooms were very well done and nice. the staff was very helpful and would go back again."
"Baur au Lac",,"Incomparable!","The service at the Baur Au Lac is beyond compare. It would justify a trip to Zurich, just to stay at the Baur Au Lac. I suffered a back injury during my trip to Zurich and the Baur Au Lac staff guided me to the right doctors and took care of my every need. The hotel's restaurant has an excellent chef and the concierges are extremely knowledgeable about where to dine and how to enjoy the city. Can't wait to return!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing in everyway","Ive been lucky enough to have stayed in this hotel a few times but whenever I visit Zurich, I always go there for a drink and sometimes food. The staff are so friendly and always remember you, the service is excellent and it makes the trips that more memorable. The food is always good whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner. The rooms are always beautiful and very clean. Looking forward to my next visit!"
"Baur au Lac",,"An Incredible Hotel","The room was large and excellent. The service from the front desk was outstanding. The concierge desk was perhaps the best I have ever dealt with. You should use their services especially when making restaurant reservations."
"Baur au Lac",,"Perfection","Not much more needs to be said about the Baur Au Lac that hasn’t already been said. It is the definition of a 5-star hotel. Hotel, Staff, Food, Service, Housekeeping, etc… all on par if not superior to anything else. It’s a large hotel, but you don’t get the sense that its crowded. Concierge was very helpful in selecting dining options that suited our needs and timeframe. Room was overlooking the river (or is it a canal?) and seeing the swans swim up the water-way while having coffee in the morning was lovely. One note on the coffee… probably the best I had while on our trip. Breakfast buffet was very good. Take the opportunity to load-up for a day exploring Zurich Weather permitting if you want to go for a run I would pass on the hotel gym and go along the lake. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Great hotel, perfect location","Classic grand hotel in the center of Zurich, next to the lake. Location could not be any better. The hotel is charming and quality is top since the renovation. Staff is very professional and helpful. Great garden restaurant and Sunday brunch"
"Baur au Lac",,"Paradise found in Zurich","Located in its own private park in the heart of Zurich with views of Lake Zurich and the Alps, the Baur au Lac offers everything one could ask for it this class of hotel. Yes, it is expensive but not much more so than, say, Paris or NYC. We were upgraded to a lovely room with balconies, view of lake and the small Schanzengraben river. It was available upon arrival which was amazing as we took an overnight flight. Employees are first rate and the most valuable asset of any business. There are a lot of choices for hotels in Zurich. You will not go wrong by choosing Baur au Lac."
"Baur au Lac",,"Perfect hotel","This is a place for relaxation, luxury, noble & aristocratic at the same time you are in the heart of the event, business and town center. Impeccable Service, food and hospitality. Daily seminars, workshops, meeting and conference at this hotel which make from it the heart of the city of Zurich "
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellence and Courtesy","A great experience characterized by professionalism and courtesy. Excellent service and rooms, comfortable space, great restaurants, high level service and very professional Staff and service. A high-class place to be recommend definitely."
"Baur au Lac",,"Modern Update of a Classic Hotel","The Baur au Lac is a luxurious grand hotel that is unbelievably well maintained and updated with the latest modern features. The expansive front park/garden extends from the hotel front door to almost the shore of Lake Zurich. The staff is very helpful. Zurich's main high-end shopping street, Bahnhofstrasse, is just one block away. There were only two negatives during our stay. There is construction just across the adjacent canal where an office building is being built. Although no work occurred during the night, it could get quite noisy during the day. Obviously the hotel has no control over this. The other issue is a small one. The combination bath tub/shower was not easy to climb in and out of for a healthy middle-aged couple. It is probably unusable by people with"
"Baur au Lac",,"Absolute luxury!","Everything is quality about this hotel - food, furnishings, lighting, service, location. While it is reassuringly expensive even by Swiss standards, functions such as the wedding we attended cost no more than an average hotel would have charged in the UK."
"Baur au Lac",,"Best location in Zurich, stylish and classy 5 star hotel","I stayed 2 nights at this very classy hotel, at the end of Zurich's main street in the historic part of town, Bahnhofstrasse, and almost facing the lakeshore. Customer service was excellent, especially at check in and check out, and at the restaurants. The room was big for European standards, very well appointed in a classic yet modern style, with ultra comfortable king bed. I didn't particularly like the view of the canal, but that's my personal point of view, I can see other travelers enjoyed it very much. The marble bathroom was simply huge and beautiful. Room service was excellent and quick. There's obviously turndown service every late afternoon, housekeeping is accurate in every detail. Since it was my first stay at a LHW hotel, I received complimentary breakfast each"
"Baur au Lac",,"One of the best hotels in the world!","Everything was perfect. The hotel has been redone with every modern convenience, but retains its beautiful old world ambience. The location is perfect, right on the lake and convenient to everything from the train station and the national museum to the fancy shops and the opera. And the Swiss chocolate shops were close by, too. The staff couldn't have been better. The maid had my shoes shined without my even asking. The Concierges were very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. No complaints at all. Just praise and compliments. Perfect! "
"Baur au Lac",,"One of the Best Hotels in the World","The Bar Au Lack Hotel is outstanding in every possible way - it is at the top of the list worldwide in our opinion From the location, quality of service and accommodations. And the food is truly outstanding. Not inexpensive... but worth every penny"
"Baur au Lac",,"Very Good, the breakfast is terrible almost to ruin the hotel","Was expecting fantastic. The location is marvelous. The staff is wonderful. The rooms are very comfortable. The small terrace with a view of the canal and Lake Zurich is special. The service and food in the breakfast area is almost tragic. The room is beautiful. The food, some nice cheese and other dairy you would expect at any fine hotel in Switzerland. The service is oddly uncomfortable. There are an army of servers who do almost nothing except ask if they can get you anything and then either bring it after an unusually long time or just forget to bring it at all... still instead of sparkling, tea instead of coffee, lemon instead of cream, I am still waiting for my orange juice! Embarrassing for such a wonderful hotel. Room service is much better. House keeping staff is"
"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic hotel with historic charm and extraordinary service!","The hotel is located at the center of Zurich, great location, very convenient and within walking distance to many attractions in the city. Every aspect of this hotel is simply amazing: great staff, fantastic room, outstanding food, and high-quality amenities. There are two things that set Baur au Lac apart from the other luxury hotels I've stayed at: 1. the extreme attention to details; 2. complimentary mini-bar. 1. I can't state enough how delighted I was with the attention to details Baur au Lac presented: the espresso machine was filled with water upon arrival; housekeeping noticed that we drank specific espresso and left extra pods; timely turn down service; extra water left on the coffee table, etc. It is these fine details that excel the experience to another level. It's"
"Baur au Lac",,"Wow","So beautiful, really a fantastic hotel. I know it is expensive but if you can splurge for a night, enjoy every minute. Also, the food is fantastic. The orchids everywhere were beautiful. Also a great location in the heart of Zurich. I would come back here."
"Baur au Lac",,"Modern Grandeur","We stayed 2 nights in this Grand Hotel with a long history. The location is perfect very close to the lakeshore and in the middle of the centre. We received an upgrade to a junior suite with a large separate living room. The design and facilities in the room were state-of-the-art. The overall-service in the hotel was impeccable. The first night the Summer Garden Party was organized in the large garden where more than 1.000 guests were expected. As 'consolation' for the extra noise and inconvenience caused by this all hotel-guests were invited to join this party. So we did and we had a fantastic evening with lot of nice food and drinks and great musical entertainment. The next evening we enjoyed dinner at Le Pavillon, the 1* restaurant which was also very nice. Needless to say"
"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic, a hotel at the top of its game!","I visited Baur Au Lac last month for a weekend whilst I took part in a sporting event and I have to say I couldn't fault it. From the first moment of our arrival at the airport where we were greeted with our driver to flying out 4 days later it was an experience that hasn't been matched. Our driver was super professional and couldn't have been more helpful with all of our bags and my bike in a box. The reception staff and concierge were brilliant, with local knowledge, tips and their general manner made us feel at home and very welcome. What really did it for me though was the food and beverage department and the deputy manager (sorry i have forgotten your name), who went out of his way to make sure all of my fussy catering needs prior to my race was catered for. This included a"
"Baur au Lac",,"Nice location","It's one the best hotels near the city , the location is nice , but the style of the hotel between classic and modern, the room really great and nice , the worst thing in the room was the Pillow in the bed , very thin , not comfortable , overall nice experience "
"Baur au Lac",,"Brilliant Baur au Lac","One of the finest hotels in Switzerland. Pure elegance with wonderful accommodation in a beautiful location walking distance to the lake and the old part of Zurich. The staff are superb with great attention to detail. They cant do enough for you to ensure you have a wonderful stay. The hotel has been one of the finest for many years and the staff do everything to uphold this. Its where you want to be in Zurich"
"Baur au Lac",,"Terrace","Love the outdoor terrace for drinks and people watching. The summer cocktails are delightful and the experience is refreshing. The outdoor vibe is classy and view of the lake is very relaxing. When in Zurich, a must place to enjoy a drink or two."
"Baur au Lac",,"Hospitality plus","This has to be one of the great hotels! From the moment we arrived till the moment we left nothing was too difficult for this wonderful place. Sarah at reception was one of the best and had such a welcoming smile. Our room was top grade. The Terrace is such an oasis. Breakfasts in The Pavilion were excellent. The concierge, Jeremie, was a font of useful information. An outstanding hotel in all respects. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Exceptional in every way!","This is a truly grand hotel, with the old world charm and class and the modern amenities for the 21st Century traveller. It is located by Lake Zurich and has its own park overlooking the Lake. Drinks on the terrace are excellent. We had a Junior Suite overlooking the canal. It was very quiet and beautifully appointed. The marble bathroom is very spacious. The bed is very comfortable. Room service is prompt and the food is outstanding, as is their wine selection. Everyone at the property is helpful and nice, and extends a warm welcome. Elegance and class, excellent hotel!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Masters of hospitality.","Arrived in Zurich on a gorgeous morning after flying directly from Sydney via Hong Kong. Taxi ride into city was relaxing and not too long. And then we arrived at Baur Au Lac. Tired. Smiling porter greeted us and took our luggage. Smiling Sarah checked us in. Our room not quite ready. No problem. Take a seat. Have some water. How about some coffee? Wow! She was so wonderful to us exhausted travellers. Our room....an indulgence really. Lunch in the garden - yummy gazpacho, excellent caesar salad. Fantastic and prompt service given we were asleep on our feet. Flower arrangements superb. Excellence in all aspects of hospitality. Love being here."
"Baur au Lac",,"Perfection in the extreme!","All is right with the world.... Pavilion Restaurant at the Baur au Lac Hotel, both true classical institutions in Zurich. In my opinion one of the best hotel / restaurant combinations in Switzerland. At first glance the selection on the food menu seems dwarfed and somewhat limited, especially in comparison to the immense wine list. But, you soon come to realise there's a reason Rolls Royce don't make 50 different models. Every dish is professionally crafted to the extreme. Sounds pretentious I know, but I'm still not sure how you can get so excited over 100ml of Gazpacho! But it's the fact it's infused with herbs and a frozen sorbet of Spanish tomatoes. I live in Spain about half of the year, so Gazpacho is a staple, but nowhere near the quality and thought that's put into"
"Baur au Lac",,"Superb location, slightly dated experience","Before moving to Switzerland, we used to stay at this hotel on many occasions. This summer, to enjoy the summer fireworks we decided to stay at the hotel for a change. The hotel has been fully renovated over the years but the rooms although perfectly clean and well laid out, feel somewhat dated and in the style and format of the old Grand Dame design which is resplendent in many hotels in Switzerland. However, the shower and bathroom facilities were impeccable with good amenities with perfect cleanliness. The bedroom was a courtyard room which was quiet, light and airy. The air-conditioning unit was slightly on the noisy side but otherwise excellent. Having reserved the room specifically for the fireworks, we were very disappointed that the hotel did not at the time"
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury on the lake shore","The Baur Au lac is a real gem. It's prime location on the lakeside with its large garden and impressive public areas are outstanding Our room on the third floor was elegant but not large enough The restaurants are very good and include in their menu many vegetarian and veggie dishes A wide variety of items are available at the garden restaurant"
"Baur au Lac",,"Absolutely beautiful hotel","We quickly fell in love with the Baur au Lac, it has such great character. We were only able to stay for two nights, but would be quick to recommend for anyone traveling to Zurich. Also highly recommend taking advantage of the restaurant Pavillion during your stay, wonderful staff and delicious food!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great Location","We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel has a great location, around the corner from Bahnhofstrasse, shopping at its best. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at the Rive Gauche. Hotel delivered a birthday cake to room after we checked in, nice touch. We enjoyed our stay. Unable to give the hotel a 5 star recommendation because of experience at salon and tub in bathroom. I was kept waiting when I arrived at salon for my appointment, no one was at reception desk. Hair stylist finally helped me. The hotel does not have a separate area for nail appointments. Sat in chair of hair salon for my manicure. This was not a very enjoyable experience. I left feeling very disappointed. Bathroom in our room only had a tub, no walk in shower. Difficult to"
"Baur au Lac",,"Jupiter56","A prime example of an overhyped hotel which is just not value for money. Shower without much force and that too Luke warm water at max control. No tea or coffee making facility. TV located to give u a crick in the neck. No toiletries barring some shampoo. Most rooms have no view of the lake. 770 chf for deluxe double room with street noise without breakfast. Acrobatics required to enter the bath tub. No value for money. In the same locality, plenty of excellent four stars at 30% price and a sumptuous Swiss breakfast and expresso machine. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing!!","I've been over 5 times and I have to say that everything is well organized and on time. Like the Swiss mentality !! I didn't have any bad experience with this hotel. The restaurants were all the time really well organized, not like in other countries. You can sense the quality in those hotels in Switzerland. !! We were really happy!!! Thank you"
"Baur au Lac",,"Terrible and over rated","We stayed in July 2015 and fount there to be pompous and arrogant staff at this cold and dirty hotel. Checked out after one night so didn't get to see much of Zurich. Also found glass in the bed to which the hotel staff seemed least bothered about. "
"Baur au Lac",,"An oasis in a major European city","We have traveled extensive for three decades, but this was our first trip to Zurich. The city is wonderful, but the Baur au Lac was the icing on the cake. Wonderful facility, rooms, public spaces and a great Michelin 1*. We loved the special art exhibit, the location at the junction of the lake and the old town. You can't beat the total experience."
"Baur au Lac",,"Wow","I do really love this place. The city is great but this hotel is really super great. It's elegant it's warm it's absolutely perfect . You can ask whatever you want and they will be able to provide it in a sec! Breakfast is delicious ! Try if u can a suite!!!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great Stay Even for Families","We stayed at the Baur au Lac for 2 nights for the first part of our summer holiday through Switzerland. We booked a junior suite for 2 adults and 2 small children. We had a fantastic stay here. Service was very good, staff were very experienced and the hotel itself was beautiful and exceptionally located. I will note that we also stayed 2 nights at the Park Hyatt in Zurich on this trip and the Park Hyatt was amateur hour in comparison to the Baur au Lac (see my other review on Park Hyatt Zurich). We stayed at 5 different hotels on our trip and this was probably the best of our stays on this trip. Pros: - Location was amazing. A hop and a skip away from the heart of Bahnhofstrasse (the shopping district) and I understand it is also in the heart of CBD. We were fortunate"
"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic","Of all the hotels in all the cities in all the world that have graced me with their beauty this Hotel stands at the very peak. I spent several nights in Zürich on a business trip. I have never stayed at. Baur au Lac before. I will return. I had breakfast with the Prince from Jordan. I had dinner with a peer of the realm. After my necessary trip to Hombrechtikon I shopped along Bahnhofstrasse I bought great wine and a 1986 Armagnac from Baur au Lac Wines. Don't miss this destination. And don't be intimidated by the fact you are not driving a Rolls-Royce"
"Baur au Lac",,"Extraordinary","The hotel's staff are superbly trained, highly capable and provide extraordinary service at every turn. The hotel is immaculate and all beautifully outfitted. A real pleasure to spend time here - I truly wish I could have stayed a few more days!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great place to be","Every way you look at it Baur au Lac is a gem. Its classy, great location, great food and service. Beautiful view of the lake. They have beautiful rooms and a very extensive menu. I would certainly recommend it."
"Baur au Lac",,"Nice visit","Great location, nicely appointed rooms but booked a single room and it was very small, Disappointing that there are no spa facilities or pool, concierge & front of house was exceptional they were so helpful and friendly, overall I found it very expensive and I cant say I found great value for money and the lack of leisure facilities might just be the reason I am not giving this hotel top marks, although Zurich is an expensive city so I would imagine this is standard throughout the city. If you are looking for a nice hotel for business this is a good pick but don't expect any frills."
"Baur au Lac",,"What happens to the great old lady on the lake?","What has happened to that great old lady on Lake Zurich? I always think of the Baur au Lac as a fabulous oldie world hotel with perfect service and in the past 20 years that I have been staying there, that is what you got. What has happened? On first seeing the new Baur au Lac - what is that stupid Andy Warhol- like exhibition in the garden ( why put anything there- the garden is beautiful as it is?) Then go inside and what has happened to the perfection? Our bags were dropped off earlier- why were they not in our rooms???And then inside the rooms ( I was part of a larger party) in one room there was no tissues, another no slippers, another person put in a room on the street when they asked for a quiet room. My own experience was in the dining room at breakfast - for 3 days"
"Baur au Lac",,"Leading Hotel in Zurich","From the moment you arrive your welcome experience begins from the valet service to the front desk reception. Friendly, helpful and a sense of belonging is immediate. Rooms are well appointed, comfortable and quiet. Breakfast is provided a la carte or buffet and the staff is courteous and attentive. The hotel has beautiful gardens, and is located within walking distance of all attractions. The concierge team is knowledgeable and exceed your expectations. They not only address your needs, but also make you feel you shouldn't leave the hotel. I would return to the Baur au Lac, without hesitation. "
"Baur au Lac",,"It is simply an ideal place in town centre","It is an ideal place in the centre of Zurich, where you can go walking any where in few minutes , it is elegant, classy and busy hotel with good deluxe rooms , It has a magnificent garden with perfect cafe & restaurant"
"Baur au Lac",,"Top notch on everything","Great place to stay in Zurich right on the lake, close to everything, shopping and old town. Tons of great restaurants in the area. Hotel management cater to your every need. The hotel is 5 stars and you can feel it. Mini bar was complementary, breakfast and lunch outstanding, but a bit pricey. "
"Baur au Lac",,"The Grand Dame of zurich","It was my first time back to Zurich in 20 years and i was so lucky to have the opportunity to stay at the Baur au Lac. The service, the facilities, the excellent location made of this institution of Zurich one of the best place to be."
"Baur au Lac",,"Lovely room decor and Terrace Bar with garden and lake view","I had been longing to stay in this famous hotel for years and loved the overall look and comfort of everything. The decor was stunning, and the service was exceptional. I was somewhat disappointed, however, in the food at the Terrace Bar and our breakfast in the Pavillion. I knew we would be paying top dollar to stay at this luxury hotel in an expensive city, and I expected the food to match the quality of the hotel."
"Baur au Lac",,"Dont left anything behind","After check out from the hotel I remembered to have left behind a shirt in the room. Called the hotel half an hour later but they told me that they could not find the shirt. It was gone! Called hotel a few times more but nothing was found. That is really a shame that item left behind disappears after you checkout. Breakfast buffet with very limited choices was not very appealing either. Croissants were tasteless. Not crispy but like a sponge. Junior suite 234 sofa was allover marked with different stains. We could not even got close to it. One expects better from a hotel call themselves as the best in Zurich. 😞"
"Baur au Lac",,"Absolutely superb","This is 5* at its best. Very expensive but all superb; from our first arrival to when we left. Excellent staff who make you feel welcome to an excellent room. Very well appointed; beautiful bathroom and attention to detail. We are LHW members so have seen some lovely hotels. This is expensive (very much so!!) but if you have a chance stay here when in Zurich"
"Baur au Lac",,"Thank you!","What a fabulous hotel! Everything was perfect from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. Every single employee was so efficient, friendly and above all welcoming. The front desk as well as the Concierge were excellent! The breakfast was delicious and the terrace was so serene with views of the gardens and the lake. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Zurich! A big thank you to everyone there! Special thanks to Carole Baumann and Panagiotis Karagiannis for taking such great care of me! Hope to see you all again soon!"
"Baur au Lac",,"there are luxury hotels and then there is the Baur au Lac","There are only a handful of hotels in the world which can approach the Baur au Lac for quality and service. it is just a few steps from the commercial center but sitting in the garden overlooking the lake it is all left behind. the public rooms are beautiful, dining superb and the only surprise was a small gym with just two treadmills.Sure it is costly but you get what you pay for"
"Baur au Lac",,"Baur au Lac was Zurich in one's heart.","I was definitely impressed by this family run hotel. Excellent amenities, excellent service and excellent food. The only complaint I had was that the airconditioning was not cold enough for me. It was definitely a great experience staying here."
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing restaurant and bar","Incredibly tasty food in the garden on a sunny day. We had lunch and were very happy with everything, great wine recommendation, all super! We returned later for a drink at the bar - it must have been the tastiest and also most creative cocktail I've ever had, it was like a desert...! Love it!!! I greatly recommend both the restaurant and the bar. And they have a real Renoir in the hallway!!! I would go back in a heart beat. Unfortunately we did not stay overnight, ,so I can not rate the rooms. There is free wifi everywhere in the hotel, restaurant and bar also for people who do not reside in the hotel."
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury personified","I stayed in Baur Au Lac for 2 nights to attend a business conference organised by a Swiss bank. Locationwise it is very strategic. Just a short walk from Borsenstrasse tram stop and Paradeplatz and just across the main road is the Burkliplatz where you can take the ferry. Cafes are plenty along Bleicherweg not far from the hotel. Of course if you are loaded location is not really a problem as the hotel has a fleet of luxury cars at your disposal. I should comment that the mini bar is for the guests to enjoy and refills are offered every morning. Too bad my meals and drinks were fully provided for during the stay that I did not take full advantage of the minibar. The 1-Michelin starred Pavillion Restaurant in my opinion serves the best Eggs Benedict. I should have known about"
"Baur au Lac",,"Classy","Great hotel , old fashion style but really upscale! Nice spacious rooms and fantastic staff. Very nice lounge for a snack and a drink and the bar restaurant has exceptional food and service. It is an expensive hotel and it shows from the moment you go into the driveway. Overall great stay"
"Baur au Lac",,"Cant sleep here","Cheched in yesterday. So much noise that we cant sleep on 4th floor. Avoid this hotel. Concierge proposed ear props. Wholy ghost when you pay 800 dollars per night. Rest of hotel is ok and service is good. But no warning even for this terrible disturbance."
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing hotel in an incredible location","Our stay was very relaxing in a large beautifully decorated room with equally stunning bathroom. Fitness area was surprisingly luxurious with incredible views and outdoor sitting area. Staff were very friendly."
"Baur au Lac",,"Simply the best!","What a wonderful experience. The room was spacious and lovely. The property was exceptional. Dining was delightful. The staff was professional, and yet warm and friendly. We highly recommend this place."
"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic Hotel","Fantastic hotel . This my second time to stay in the Baur Au Lac hotel Zurich. A fantastic hotel with a fabulous service very friendly and helpful staff. Regarding to my suite is a unique beautifully decorated and housekeeping make more beautiful. Le Hall is a nicely decorated with a very qualified staff.

This a short brief of a fabulous and fantastic hotel Most important is the hotel location walking distance to lake and bahnhofstrasse Soon coming Back"
"Baur au Lac",,"second chance","My previous visit to the Baur au Lac was a disappointment on a number of fronts but, as they say, everyone deserves a second chance and this time around I had an excellent stay. My greeting at reception was brilliant, the room superb (quiet and well appointed) with a great bathroom (OK an upgrade was involved), and the service was swift and most attentive (I needed an adaptor quickly). No problems with early morning room service on this occasion as I went to the restaurant and enjoyed the best buffet breakfast I have had anywhere outside Asia, in very convivial surroundings with a selection of newspapers available. (Cooked eggs can also be ordered from the kitchen and the freshly brewed coffee comes in a personal pot as you would expect.) Whilst the small gym only opens at 06.30"
"Baur au Lac",,"Attention, Thief in the hotel","I will never stay again with this hotel. This is the most terrible experience I've ever encountered in Switzerland, and for such a hotel with long history, I think this is also a shameful page. The story is simple, I have stayed for a weekend, and on Sunday afternoon I checked out and had an afternoon tea in the lobby. It takes about 2-3 hours, and I suddenly realized that I have left my watch in the room. So I immediately contact the concierge to find it. During the hours I didn't even step out of the door of the hotel. But apparently the watch is gone. I don't want to mention the brand but it is a really expensive one and a gift from my fiance. After contacted the police and checked the key list it showed that only one cleaning lady has been to the room"
"Baur au Lac",,"Superb stay!","Amazing hotel, fantastic service and the bar is superb! rooms are beautiful and have that old fashion feeling with a modern twist; the choice of restaurant will blow your mind and if you feel like a drink or two, the bar staff is amazing! especially the italian guy...he really knows his job!!!!!will definitely go back soon;"
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent, highly recommend this place","We went to Baur au lac for one night as we did a stop in Zurich before heading to Luzern. This hotel has everything for you to enjoy your stay. Service is excellent, rooms really nice, confortable and equipped with latest technology (the Ipad with directory, room-service menu on it is just great), Bathroom really confortable as well. We appreciated all little attentions we had during our stay, and all together we definitely place this hotel in our top 5."
"Baur au Lac",,"Traditional Swiss hospitality","This hotel provides traditional Swiss hospitality at its finest. Location, interior, food and exprience in general is great. Expensive? Absolutely but you also get what you pay for which among other things is a spacious room and good service."
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent location and outstanding Hotel","The Baur au Lac deserves its Five Star rating. It is well located in Zurich ( practically Lake Front but also within walking distance of the major shopping areas ) , quality facilities and extraordinary service . Well trained staff. The price is also in line with its rating and reputation. Only downside is the Fitness Center. Nice layout and good equipment but a bit small."
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent","Outstanding hospitality in terms of Room service, Food quality, concierg, housekeeping service. Overall stay was comfortable and must say Excellent Service!!! Definitely will look foward to stay again in my future visits."
"Baur au Lac",,"Perfect 👌🏻","Very nice hotel right next to the zurich lake, the location is perfect for tourist, the old city is located very close to the hotel about 5 minutes walking. The rooms are also very nice and the service in the hotel is on a high level. The prices are quiet high but is worth it."
"Baur au Lac",,"Extraordinary","My favorite hotel in Zurich. Better than the Park Hyatt or the Dolder Grand. Old world charm, beautifully appointed rooms, wonderful bathrooms, exceptional service, huge bill at the end of your stay...what more could you want? Ok, so maybe you want to pay less, but if you can afford it this is the place to stay."
"Baur au Lac",,"I need a grammar lesson","I am becoming paranoid. I used to think I wrote beautifully and then I made the mistake of reading Jeremy Clarke in the magazine that this fascistic website will probably not allow me to mention. My God that man can pen a word. Be it romantic, be it morbid, hedonistic, our Jezza hits the spot like a good 'un. He would have no problem on Trip (a concept with which he is no stranger) Advisor. I, on the other hand, am now mere dust beneath his drug-addled wheels and, anyway, if you deviate 'from zee Party line' on this site they don't publish you and I want to world to know how utterly wonderful is the Baur au Lac. There is a part of me saying that it jolly well should be because it costs what Vladimir Putin earns in a microsecond but the room I was given was so beautifully"
"Baur au Lac",,"One if the best hotels in the world","There are only a handful of truly great hotels left in the world and the Baur au Lac is one of them. Great service from the moment you walk through the front door. All the public spaces and the rooms are perfect."

The very best hotel in Zurich , by the lake wonderful surroundings fantastic food and atmosphere. Staff absolutely fantastic, the staff really cares very much to make your stay a wonderful experience. Robert "
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury at its best","I stayed at this superb hotel in the heart of Zurich for only one night but it was just fantastic! Room service ordering is very modern (taken with Samsung tablets). The restaurant is delicious. Try the chocolate cake for dessert! I was in a single room, very very spacious with a bathroom which has a bath tub and a shower. Twice the room service per day is very professional. Staff is elegant, nice and welcoming. Finally the breakfast was PER-FECT! The environment of the restaurant, the atmosphere, the food choice, cheese, butter, croissants, bread, omelettes, Nutella crêpes... And fresh fruits ! The next time I go to Zurich, I will not ask myself any questions and go directly to Baur au Lac! "
"Baur au Lac",,"My hotel of choice in Zurich","Never ceases to deliver. Not the most amazing 5 star of all times in terms of looks but more efficient and regular than a Patek Philippe watch. Great service, swiss german cleanliness and efficiency, extremely comfortable beds and an amazing location moments from the Lake and Bahnhofstrasse. My hotel of choice for business and pleasure. A little on the expensive side but there is not another hotel in Zürich quite like this one."
"Baur au Lac",,"Weekend in Zurich","Beautiful hotel fabulous attentive staff. Lovely city to spend a long weekend in. Many restaurants and shops, very clean in all areas and transport system with the trams was easy and convenient to use."
"Baur au Lac",,"What a property","This hotel is totally over the top. Location can't be better. Rooms are extremely clean and taken care of.

"Baur au Lac",,"EXCELLENT HOTEL IN A GREAT LOCATION","Although my short was stay, I would highly recommend this hotel: LOCATION: Convenient for our car service and in a great location to walk/run to Old Town Zurich SERVICE: Impecable. I had made a few requests prior to arrival and the hotel staff was quick to assist. GYM: Excellent for a hotel gym. The area was great for running and walking, too. FOOD: I only had room service, but was please with the quality, timing and service. ROOM: I've traveled a lot and for Europe, in particular, these rooms were fabulous. Spacious, well appointed and with character. I would highly recommend this hotel and will return again on another trip. I want to thank the Staff for their attention to detail and assisting with my requests. Loved this stay and this hotel!!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent taste-menu, great experience, perfect setting","We celebrated our birthday here this year. I strongly recommended their taste menu with wine pairing. It was a really excellent experience- the food, the layout and the service was all perfect. If there is one thing that could probably improve, the suit of the lead waitor is slightly over-size and could be more fit."
"Baur au Lac",,"Best service in the world","From The moment we stepped out of our town car arriving at the Baur au Lac: we felt very well cared for and we appreciated the amazing level of service. The manager of the restaurant for the breakfast service and lunch his name is JJ and he is so amazing. He offers a quiet level of service that is second to none in making sure all of your needs are taken care of... The location is perfect for shopping and for walking around the lake. The hotel room was first class and very well appointed and quite large. The newly renovated lobby lounge is beautifully decorated in classic antique style. We will definitely stay at this hotel when we visit again. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Incredible","Incredible hotel and staff. Stayed in Junior suites and the size and appointments in the room were superb. Staff are just amazing and always go out of their way top help with any request. The reception is old school and very efficient which is part of the hotels charm. The Baur au Lac really is the standard that other hotels should strive to achieve. Its certainly not the cheapest but it is definitely the best . Timothy"
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing property","Fresh, lively, rich, vibrant, etc. Hotel lives up to the expectation of the guests. Rooms are just superb. Maintained very well and no compromise. Beautiful garden around the hotel fresh flowers all around the hotel is very energising. The only property which he access to receive guests right at the aircraft on landing in Zurich airport. "
"Baur au Lac",,"The best city hotel in Europe","As always I was staying at Baur au Lac early January this year. This is a truly professional place. From your arrival to the departure everything works like a Swiss watch. The service is impeccable. The room large and comfortable. There is an old fashion atmosphere of quality and dignity. There is no sign of ""design hotel"" or ""boutique hotel"", thank heaven. Only oldfashioned quality at its best."
"Baur au Lac",,"Best way to celebrate the New Year","We booked ourselves into a junior suite for New Year's Eve as a treat and a treat it was. The suite overlooked the lake and was located on the third floor so perfect to observe the fire works at midnight. The suite as such was very spacious and stunningly appointed. The furnishings were opulent and comfortable and the marble bathroom the stuff of dreams. The staff were delightful, perfectly professional just as you would expect from a deluxe hotel. The building itself is exquisite, a beautifully restored building from centuries ago and perfectly located at the lake. This is not a typical 5 star luxury chain hotel, but a family run establishment and it shows. You can tell that the staff are loyal to the house and have given their professional lives to the Baur. The buffet"
"Baur au Lac",,"Disappointing. And dangerous if you have dietary requiremetns.","I went to Baur au Lac recently for afternoon tea. I called the restaurant 5 days in advance to book and to let them know that I am gluten intolerant, and this was again confirmed when we were seated. The food arrived and I was told that the sandwiches and scones were gluten free. About 15 minutes later a waitress came and told me that the scones are in fact not gluten free, but that these would arrive shortly. Fortunately we hadn't started eating them yet! After another 15 minutes I enquired about the whereabouts of my scones, only to be told another 10 minutes later that there will not be any gluten free scones at all but that I could have a piece of chocolate cake instead, if I ""wanted to"". I then also asked about the other sweets on the cake stand and was told quite"
"Baur au Lac",,"classic ....","The Hall at the Baur au Lac has re-opened this year and as much as I miss the old paintings and the old furniture I have to admit that the service has become much better and there are more seating places ... if you want a private conversation avoid the 4 tables in the middle as the accoustics under the coupola are bad ... ....and it is very expensive ...."
"Baur au Lac",,"A classy experience!","This hotel is an outstanding jewel located at the lake of Zurich and just a stone throw away from the famous Bahnhofstrasse. The service is spot on and it's really a true leading hotel of the world. Their garden is in summer time a real oasis to have a drink or something to eat. I highly recommend their tartar! Plenty of great details, quality, history and class throughout the hotel."
"Baur au Lac",,"delicious scones for tea","last year reopened Le Hall is quiet a pearl in zurich. scones with genuine taste of south england's best accompaniment for tea. especially the supervisor runs his team with high professionalism, real 5 star level.(Mr.Wernicke) if you are looking for some rest in zurich having coffee or tea there is no better service at all. only there is no view to the lake."
"Baur au Lac",,"Not for this business traveller....","Great location, excellent service (think of the linen kindly provided by the staff to cover the heads of FIFA officers arrested in dawn raids this year), efficient valet parking and lovely surroundings cannot off-set the flaws and disadvantages that I have experienced at this historic location. Flaws ? At a five star hotel in Zurich that charges accordingly ? Indeed. Breakfast served at the wrong time (half an hour early) and, unsurprisingly, the wrong order (though it took a while to convince the waitress). A taxi ordered the night before that turned up more than 10 minutes late for a tight run to the airport, with the concierge being unconcerned and taking no action. Disadvantages ? Indeed. The fitness centre opens at 06.30 and closes at 22.00 so if you have an early morning"
"Baur au Lac",,"Picturesque and convenient!","Great service, great location (a walking distance from Lake Geneva, the financial district, and the famous shopping district Bahnofstrasse. Traditional in style, (but fully equipped with all the modern bells and whistles), staying at Baur au Lac feels a little like travelling back in time. Note: - the gym has an amazing view! - check out Kronenhalle, a short walking distance away =) famous restaurant where you dine amongst art"
"Baur au Lac",,"Unique hospitality","After lots of travelling around the world and staying in lots of hotels it's not so easy to get amazed. But i was really amazed by the hospitality of this hotel's team! Not that the building and the suite does not diserve to be mentioned but i think that the high quality of the team's service keeps it to the top not only of Zurich's but of all the European hotels! I also have to mention the hotel's restaurant as extraordinary! I think that the price for this unique accomodation experience is fair enough!!! We will be back...for sure!"
"Baur au Lac",,"BEAUTIFUL STATELY HOTEL, FANTASTIC SERVICE","Beautiful 170 year old hotel, lovingly maintained, great location - a block from the major shopping district - staff is superb! My husband needed medication at 1:00 am -- was able to email the prescription to the concierge on duty, who contacted the pharmacy and had it delivered to the hotel within an hour. Only complaint is that it is very near the lake -- but set back so no panoramic views from the rooms --but service, location, level of comfort made up for that. Would definitely recommend."
"Baur au Lac",,"Honeymoon trup","The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and helpful in every way. The location of the hotel is also good and nearby everything. The food was also very good. We loved the room we stayed in and it was very nice and beautiful and had a warm feeling to it."
"Baur au Lac",,"Setting is perfect","The Hotel is so well situated.It has everything.Views,food,fresh air,swans!The service was great and the food I ordered was perfect.I just could not fault anything.I am looking forward to going there soon."
"Baur au Lac",,"Great place, but a bit shop-worn in the two rooms we stayed in.","Stayed at this luxury hotel for the first time with my wife, after 34 years of staying in, or transiting Zurich by air/rail, including on our honeymoon in 1982. We arrived from a 2 week stay in southern Switzerland on the way back to the states. We had room service both nights of our stay, which was both timely and excellent as we were too tired for a long dinner in one of their fabulously beautiful restaurants. The food arrived quickly and was better than most places you'd eat-out at, in urban, upscale locales. The room was on level 2, facing the street (called a 'city view') and was fairly noisy for such a setting, being at at stop light intersection, so morning traffic noise of commuters was significant between 7:30AM and later. It did settle down by 9AM. It didn't"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great location, great hotel","I had not stayed at the Baur au Lac for a long time and I must say I was really pleased with my room and with the service. Very friendly check-in. Large room, with great television, good working desk. Large bathroom with a bath-tub and a shower. Great amenities. Very nice fitness center on the top of the building with state-of-the-art equipment and a great lake view. Extremely smooth check-out. A great experience !"
"Baur au Lac",,"Epitomy of Swiss Hospitality","The Baur au Lac is the epitomy of Swiss Hospitality. From the welcome greeting by the porter., the hotel manager checking in, breakfast in the light filled restaurant, royally equipped and cared for rooms. It all fits. Sometimes you notice quirky facts about hotels you stay in. For the Baur au Lac, my memories will always be of the distance between room doors in the corridors. A hint to the size of the rooms beyond!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Exellent","The Zurich Baur Au Lac Hotel wes an excellent  choice. The most luxurious Hotels in Zurich  I ever been with a charming decoration  and  great location overlooking the Zurich Lake and  walking distance to the famous Bahnhofstrasse.  Very great and friendly over-whelming hotel staff. Our suite very spacious , beautiful brilliantly designed and comfortable. I really had a good time and it was a truly a memorable stay. For sure for my next trip to Zurich ... Baur Au Lac will be my choice. "
"Baur au Lac",,"What a great experience","We had a great stay with great food and also great event, not only was everything great organised also the staff was professional. there was nobody that had something negative to say. The food a the restaurant, we had fish, just light and lovely for a late dinner. the location of the hotel is across from the Zurich Lake, also to recommend if you have time, boat tour. the Concierge team very helpful with tips and maps :)"
"Baur au Lac",,"Baur Au Lac, best location in Zurich","I had the pleasure to enjoy three nights at the historic Baur Au Lac Hotel situated probably at one of the best locations in Zurich. The hotel and personel provides the best possible base for a luxury weekend or business stay in Zurich. You just need enough money to enjoy this facility!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Most excellent","Wonderful experience in a very luxurious hotel. Booked a few hours before arriving and beeing welcomed with a very generous upgrade to a junior suite with a gorgeous view on the lake. Bedding and breakfast are of excellent quality. And don't miss out on the chocolate in the complimentary minibar-one of the best i've ever had (""1844""). If something negative has to be said: sleeping with open windows gets quite noisy but hardly any noise if you keep them closed. Looking forward to be back! Thanks a lot"
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful Hotel","My wife and I were guests at the Baur Au Lac Hotel in Zurich and would not hesitate to recommend this property. Extremely clean and efficient service. Perfect location with top notch dining and spa experience. This is a beautiful hotel with great customer service and employees. 5 star"
"Baur au Lac",,"Expensive but Worth it!","We stayed here for a week, using Zurich as our base and taking day trips to other cities. I can't say enough good things about the staff and especially the concierge desk, the latter arranging day train trips and printing out the tickets for us. The Breakfast buffet in the Pavillion restaurant was excellent. The croissants were the best I've ever tasted and the whole restaurant was beautifully decorated with large windows overlooking the canal and lovely grounds of the hotel. Kudos to the staff for having fresh floral arrangements everywhere, with orchids emphasized. The linens were of the best quality and featured a pillow menu. The location of the hotel is just a short walk from beautiful Lake Zurich. We had dinner one night at the Rive Gauche which is one of the hotel"
"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic","best in the world personal stylish expensive but well worth it very at home the décor is sensational the staff are fabulous making you feel at home the restaurants and lobby areas are very nice to eat and drink in"
"Baur au Lac",,"Superb hotel with the nicest location","Overlooking the river that goes to the lake, this hotel has a charm on its own. Although preserving the colonial building, the room is really modern. It has wifi access, provided with power converter and lots of access to power which is essential when you are bringing multiple devices."
"Baur au Lac",,"Majestic Zurich Waterfront Hotel","After a month of traveling throughout Switzerland this summer, we spend our final 3 nights at the Baur au Lac. It is majestic from top to bottom and front to back. It is located across the street from Lake Zurich and only a block away from the Bahnhoffstrasse. It is a short walk to the old city across the river and the many museums and churches there. The temperature in Zurich was 95 degrees, but the hotel and our room had wonderful air conditioning. Our room came with breakfast and you could order what you wanted of graze at the buffer of delectable dishes. One evening it rained so we sat out in the garden area and were served wonderful wine and a light supper. For my wife's birthday, we had lunch in Pavilion. We were treated like royalty and the good was delicious and the"
"Baur au Lac",,"Best luxury and the height of service in the heart of Zurich","We visited this stellar hotel in June than again 4 or 5 weeks later as we flew into and out of Zurich for a long European vacation. Because of this hotel, which is walking distance to everything, we count our beginning and ending several days as among the best on our whole trip. The rooms are beautiful, the service over the top, the breakfast and other food is superbly prepared and the concierges curated our entire trip, not just in Zurich, but for many places in the rest of Europe as well - making and changing reservations for us in between our stays there. This hotel definitely went above and beyond the standard most hotels are able to achieve, even at their best."
"Baur au Lac",,"Top hotel","It is situated in the best location of the city close to the shopping district. The service and politeness of the staff is remarkable. The standard of rooms and bathrooms very high. A special touch of this hotel is the very interesting painting collection in all areas. Pavillion restaurant is unique with a lot of day light arround. The added value is the garden with the bar and rest which makes summer days a heaven in this hotel. Definetely the best choice for the high end market. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Classy and sophisticated by the lake","We spent 1 night at the hotel, where nearly every aspect was of a very high standard. We requested a room on a high floor to reduce noise but Initially were allocated a room on the 1st floor next to the road. Upon requesting a change of room, a very quiet room on an inner courtyard was found and was marvellous. The staff were excellent, remember names and preferences without prompting and with a great mix of informality to suit the guest. The food in the Rive Gauche restaurant is worthy of special mention. Highly recommended as is the service. "
"Baur au Lac",,"The Whole Deal","The location of this hotel is ideal for access to the shopping district, Old Town and waterfront. The service, amenities and food is 5 star +. Pavillon restaurant provides excellent breakfast and intimate dinner offerings. The 5 course tasting menu was worth the visit alone. Look forward to a return."
"Baur au Lac",,"Legend hotel","Stayed in this hotel for business for two nights in August. Although the hotel is a legendary hotel and have beautiful grounds and rooms. There is still a few things they need to perfect. Food choices and presentation on the outside terrasse and speedy service in restaurant and bell to name a few. Everyone is very nice and friendly, it feels more like an organisation issue. Saying that, I come to Zurich very regurarly and I will certainly stay again."
"Baur au Lac",,"Picturesque balcony view","A relaxing, calm and elegant stay. I loved my time at this peaceful hotel, relaxed and recharged effortlessly. The balcony view is a treat as I took it all in upon rising, do take a few moments to enjoy the stillness. You won't be dissapointed."
"Baur au Lac",,"Great location. Superb service","Everything was excellent at Baur Au Lac Hotel. It is really well located, alongside the lake and very close to everything, including the old town. The staff were friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay after 24 hours of flying from Australia."
"Baur au Lac",,"Always a Class Act","We have been staying at the Baur Au Lac for over 20 years now, whenever we visit Zurich. The Baur Au Lac has a wonderful blend of being a very first class hotel, but also warm and friendly atmosphere, with outstanding accomodations and service-- truly a pleasure to stay at the Baur Au Lac!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful property and experience","We stayed at Baur au Lac at the end of a two week vacation. We arrived in the afternoon before a morning flight back to North America, and my only complaint is that I wish we'd been able to stay there longer! The trip was in celebration of a special occasion, and having notified the hotel in advance they made us feel truly special. we thoroughly enjoyed the suite and the treats that they left for us were extremely thoughtful and much appreciated. While we did not get to experience much of Zurich or the hotel amenities, the decor and quality of the hotel were beautiful, and the service five star. Would highly recommend this hotel and it will certainly be our hotel of choice if ever back in Zurich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful stay (again)","Stayed there last week - have been there before and as always the stay was wonderful. Beautiful room. Location can't be beat.Love the garden (try the peach bellini - best I ever had). Concierge was wonderful and arranged several dinners as well as a great out of town trip to the countryside (left at 9:30 and back by 4). One of the few authentic family owned hotels left with real Swiss service and hospitality. Elegant and beautiful. Best in Zurich and one of the best in Europe. Will definitely be back."
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellence in Zurich","This quintessential luxury hotel remains one of the outstanding establishments in Europe. The excellent location just off the Banhofstrasse (Zurich's Fifth Avenue or Champs Elysées) is perfect for walking around the city, shopping in some of the most upscale stores or drinking a coffee at Sprüngli's chocolate shop. Rooms are ample (we stayed in a ""City"" suite to which we were upgraded from a ""Deluxe"" double on the third floor) and extremely well-appointed with large double sink bathrooms, robes and slippers and all the other amenities one would expect from a 5-star hotel. During the summer months drinks, tea and meals are taken outside on the terrace or in the elegant Pavilion Restaurant."
"Baur au Lac",,"Elegant hotel great location","Our family of four just stayed here fir three nights. Also appreciated nice gym - lots of windows and good equipment. Excellent service and close to lake and shopping. Delicious breakfasts too. Connecting rooms helpful for families. Very helpful concierge. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful location great service","The Lobby is great Food quality is great especially in the lobby. I recommend their sweets very much. Wonderful overall service. Friendly staff smiling and proactively. Nice outdoor park and fine dining restaurant. Few steps away from the lake. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Elegant and beautiful","This old hotel is an amazing place. It is elegant and beautiful. The staff is very attentive and you will feel like a Prince or Princes here. Well heeled people from all over the world. Drips old school elegance. The hotel has a 1 star Michelin restaurant as well. The outside bar/dining area is beautiful. Close to the lake and the Old Town. Wondeful experience."
"Baur au Lac",,"Absolutely fabulous!","This is an excellent hotel in a great setting very close to the Lake. We could not fault anything about this Hotel, All staff were very helpful and pleasant and delivered very good service. Nothing was any trouble. We stayed 2 nights at the start of our holiday and 2 nights at the end. Our rooms on each occasion were excellent but on the 2nd occasion our room was facing the inner courtyard and that was noticeably quieter than the first room which faced the road. Bathrooms were spacious and bright with separate bath and walk in shower. We ate in each of the restaurants and they were all first class. The outside terrace bar and restaurant is separated from the main road by a lovely garden area with high hedge, very relaxing. We will definitely return to this Hotel."
"Baur au Lac",,"A wonderful hotel and a beautiful setting","Had heard many great things about this hotel and they met expectations. Staff on top of everything and a well-run hotel. It felt like a true European Five Star hotel, which may not be for everyone, but I liked it!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Value for money does not match","Location is great. Had a mediocre welcome. Rooms have a great view but I would not recommend this hotel to the older generation as you literally have to climb into the bathtub to take a shower. Not easy at all even for us younger people. separate shower and bathtub would be much better. Also light switches and power outlets in the room are very confusing to use (not use friendly). Quality and taste of food is good but service needs some additional training. Getting wrong cold dishes after waiting too long at breakfast doesn't work for me. Expect much more attention to detail at a room only rate of CHF 700+ for a double deluxe."
"Baur au Lac",,"perfection","I stayed at the Baur au Lac upon arrival from the States and a second time before going home, four nights at the beginning and two at the end. It could not have been better. That's a sentence I almost never have the pleasure of writing. I took the hotel limousine service and was met at baggage claim by my driver. No getting the bags and then searching in a crowd for a card with my name. Much easier. From that moment, I could just relax and enjoy the ride to the hotel. I was traveling alone and am in my sixties so this kind of comfort and ease is no small thing, especially after twenty or more hours traveling. At the hotel, my room was not ready. It was only 9am. By the time I had breakfast in the pavilion, a really pretty all windowed room, it was. A lovely single,"
"Baur au Lac",,"Exceptional Hotel","This hotel was LOVELY! The service was impeccable and it still retained such a warm atmosphere. Our rooms were spacious and comfortable. They were clean and well appointed. We just didn't stay there long enough. The location is also wonderful. Walking to shopping and Old Town. "
"Baur au Lac",,"a great hotel","the hotel is excellent. beautifully situated. a great gym. I would highly recommend this hotel, friendly staff. easy check in and check out. transfers to and from airport were seamless BTW: having to write 200 characters is rediculous"
"Baur au Lac",,"Impressive deserving FIVE Star property","These folks went above and beyond to fulfill my family's needs. Other properties are awarded good rankings, but often do not deserve them. These people do! We needed to leave early in the morning to catch our flight home. The Front desk folks offered us take away breakfast since we were leaving before the dining room was to open. This morning as we checked out, the reception folks had four fully packed take away bags for our journey. Another nice touch, the mini bar snacks were included with the room rate, not priced outrageously as an add on. The room rates are expensive, but they provide the service and facilities to make for a perfect stay."
"Baur au Lac",,"satisfied","real value can be known after 2-3 nights stay, my case this time was 1night only, its difficult to say ""excellent"" or "" very good"". somehow, my wife and I were satisfied and would like to stay again at the next opportunity."
"Baur au Lac",,"Outstanding Place","This hotel is wonderful. The rooms are beautiful, service is amazing, it's in a good location - we will return there when we visit Zurich. While the fitness center is nice, it's very small. It would be nice to have more than 2 treadmills there for cardio equipment. Breakfast and wifi were included with our rate. Overall, it's a great place. Highly recommend!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Elite 1% Establishment","Beautiful, palatial establishment! Staying here was like what dying and going to heaven must feel like. LOL... This is the real deal for the 1% of elite travelers who want the best that money can buy."
"Baur au Lac",,"A great hotel in a great location","Having debated about choosing between three 5 star hotels was not easy. We opted for this hotel based on Location, Location,Location.Having than seen the other two, we were convinced that we made the right choice.Also the Conciege was excellent"
"Baur au Lac",,"Top","It s part of one my favorite hotel in the world regarding services , rooms, food and location. They have an excellent restaurant right outside with great clientele and food Rive gauche.a place to be. I hope I can make it to the summer party this year."
"Baur au Lac",,"Service is phenomenal, ready to return.","From the doorman on up, everyone is concerned about your comfort and satisfaction at all times. The location is very central, with close access to the Lake, to Bahnhofstrasse, the concerthall, old town, etc. The food is excellent and the restaurant in the garden is really very pleasant. The rooms have been beautifully remodeled while not very large."
"Baur au Lac",,"Pampered luxury","Before starting a two-week group tour in Switzerland and Italy, I treated myself to a stay at the Baur au Lac to recover from jet lag and see something of Zurich. The room was beautiful and comfortable, the staff amazingly warm and helpful, and my meals there were lovely. The motorized blackout window shades assured I could catch up on missed sleep, and the shower was perfection. I was slightly disappointed that the terrace restaurant was not directly on the lake, as the online photos seemed to show, but it was otherwise such a lovely spot that I had lunch and dinner there. Pricey but worth it!"
"Baur au Lac",,"the best there is in zurich","if you are interested in being where everyone who is anyone in Zurich goes, it's the Baur Au Lac. Great atmosphere. perfect location just in front of the lake with it's own gardens. highly recommend eating in the garden any afternoon. marvelous,."
"Baur au Lac",,"Number 1","This hotel is a perfect example of luxury service in hospitality industry. I decided to celebrate my birthday there, booked the rooms for myself and my friends. However I could not arrive before my friends, thus I've contacted the reception and asked them if they could not follow their standard procedure while checking in my guests and charge me when I arrive. After a while the receptionist agreed and my guests didn't feel uncomfortable during the check in. Concierge planned all activities for us for the following days and places to go in the city. Amazing attentive service in all departments. Bravo! Keep the same level of service!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Impressive.","By far -- one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The linens are the finest in the world. The rooms soundproof and solid. The staff can't do enough. And the food is very carefully prepared. There is ONLY one hotel for me in Zurich: Baur au Lac."
"Baur au Lac",,"Seriously Folks....","I really can't understand the love affair other reviewers seem to have with hotel unless price is just not an object (which may be the case?). Or perhaps my expectations are just too high for a US$950 room? I provide a summary of my experience below and frankly, alot of my opinion is based on what the hotel costs, but bottom line is I would save the money and stay somewhere cheaper (see my review last year of Hotel Widder). Reception/Check-in: Crowded and slow. Small check-in ""window"" with room for just 1-2 hotel staff. Slow on check-in and very slow on check-out. Waited in a 3 person line to check-out; don't recall doing this at a hotel in a long time especially one of this stature. Facilities/rooms: Great quality decor and furnishings with a large, beautiful bathroom."
"Baur au Lac",,"1 word: AMAZING!!","We only had one night in Zurich and decided to pamper ourselves by staying at Baur au Lac. The hotel turns out to be the best thing about Zurich! The service was hands down amazing. We arrived on an early morning flight and was at the hotel by 6.30. We thought that being a 5 star hotel, Baur might have a snooty attitude and not allowed us to check in after 12 hours of traveling. However, upon arrival, the staffs were friendly, energetic, engaged and most importantly, they had a room ready for us! Room itself is what you would expect of a proper 5 star hotel - comfy, clean, spacious, with enough thoughtful detail that you don't need to worry about a thing! We've also had brekkie at the hotel restaurant Au Pavillon. It wasn't included in our room rate but we decided to try it"
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful Stay","We spent 2 nights at the Baur au Lac and were very impressed by the quality of this hotel. First of all it is perfectly situated in central Zurich - by the lake and shopping areas. The service and hotel staff were very professional and friendly. The rooms are very well appointed and very nicely decorated. We highly recommend staying this hotel - as they is a lovely feel to it as you are staying at a family owned hotel - not a member of a huge luxurious hotel chain."
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful","Me and my husband stayed there for leisure for 3 days this month. The hotel is located in the best place in town, so we could go to many interesting places by foot. Our room was perfect, the restaurants are excellent, and the gardens make us feel in a very special place. Staff is very kind and attentive. Certainly we will come back there."
"Baur au Lac",,"Perfection","Had the opportunity to spend (2) nights at the Baur au Lac on business was very impressed with the level of service and attention to detail. The room was nicely appointed, well lit and had a warm atmosphere. What really set the hotel apart was the warm and friendly staff, everyone could not have been nicer. Best hotel in Zurich hands down. Will be back."
"Baur au Lac",,"excellent best in zurich","the team have me feel like a home away from home superb overall can highly recommend this a must place to stay take the harbour view worth a million dollars try their restaurant the drive with a gps its easy and hotel has a valet service"
"Baur au Lac",,"Swiss perfection","One of the view hotels owned by a private Familly. Ideally located by the lake with a beautiful garden, but also only a stone throw away from the world famous Bahnhofstrasse. Staff throughout the hotel is highly professional and always keen to help. The rooms are very comfortable and very quiet. Highly recommendable for business and family travel. Definitely a place to return to."
"Baur au Lac",,"Not much to say","This is a serious hotel with very professional and high level service. I think that it's not necessary to describe details. It is expensive, but if you can spend that money, you will not be sorry for any single frank."
"Baur au Lac",,"A blissful experience","A wonderful stay in a hotel which is not only beautifully decorated, but where every piece of art has its personal story. Our room had a view on the lake, overlooking the canal, and don't miss a delicious dinner in the Rive Gauche restaurant. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
"Baur au Lac",,"By far the best place to stay in Basel","This is one of Europe's great hotels. It has the right combination of old world charm and modern touches. The service is impeccable; the restaurants and bars are some of the best in the city. The views of the river are beautiful, enhanced by large windows."
"Baur au Lac",,"Loved my stay at Baur au Lac","I enjoyed every minute of my stay at Baur au Lac and wish I could have stayed longer. It is a stunning property and the staff is very warm and friendly. Everyone makes you feel very much at home. The food was outstanding! I was there for the end of winter festival and the hotel management sent me a little snowman chocolate treat. It was very special and much appreciated. Thank you Baur au Lac for a fantastic stay!"
"Baur au Lac",,"One of the truly great hotels!","Travelers of means will appreciate the history and luxury of this hotel. And all modern amenities, including WiFi and TV channels in some 10 or so languages, are included. If the budget allows it, this hotel is highly recommended. Everything is top class."
"Baur au Lac",,"Pleasureable Moments","Great Hotel with great staff who made sure we have everything we need and went out of their way to make sure we're feeling comfortable. I would like to personally express my deep appreciation to Mr. Robert Boden & Mrs. Comelia Zimmermam for making our stay a pleasurable stay. I will sure come back to your hotel because I had great time with you."
"Baur au Lac",,"Deserves its 5 stars","From the moment we drove up to the front door, we were taken care of. A valet parked our car in their nearby garage. After a quick check-in, one of the staff brought us to our rooms. This personalized gesture was very nice. Our 2 rooms were connected. Our 3 children stayed in one room with the addition of a roll away bed. The decor is a combination of modern and traditional. It was tastefully done. The bathrooms were big, with 2 sinks, a shower and tub. The hotel's lounge is beautiful with a big chandelier in the middle. Again, the feel of luxury is here. When we had breakfast, the personnel were extremely attentive. One can order hot food freshly prepared. There is the usual assortment of cold cuts, cheeses and breads at the buffet table. We certainly enjoyed our stay here."
"Baur au Lac",,"Traditional Luxury Hotel","Quite well-located near the end of Bahnhofstrasse, and as its name implies bordering Lake Zurich, the Baur au Lac has traditionally been a high-end favorite. My room was comfortable and well-appointed, though personally I prefer a more modern ""look"", especially for the bathroom. Some controls (lights, electric shutters) are hard to find/identify. The lounge, just off the reception area, is a very beautiful, chic room done in cheerful tones and with a magnificent contemporary crystal chandelier centerpiece. I recommend making time for tea or cocktails there. Front desk staff were professional. For comment on the restaurant staff, see my separate review of the Pavillon."
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing hotel - such a treat to stay here","We are just leaving this beautiful hotel today after spending two amazing nights here. Everything is perfect and just as a luxury hotel should be - it surpassed our expectations. It has a fantastic location and we enjoyed looking around the flower market (Tues and Fri). We walked everywhere and thanks to a stroke of luck with the weather, took some stunning photographs. Back to the hotel -every team member we have met has been so friendly and helpful; the rooms are the epitome of comfort and elegance and the public spaces are gorgeous. I had some of the best nights' sleep here ever - climbing into bed felt literally like climbing into a fluffy cloud. Of course this is Switzerland and things are very expensive (and thanks to the hike in the Swiss franc recently). However, we"
"Baur au Lac",,"Top 10 Hotel in the World.","I think this is one of the Top Hotel in the World of Travel. My wife and I travel a lot for both business and pleasure. I have been staying here since 1976 and the staff never fails to recognize us. They always give me my same suite."
"Baur au Lac",,"Is the place in Zurich","Exceptionally well maintained property, very clean and tidy room with excellent services. The staff are skilled, friendly, and at your service all time. A luxury hotel that provides a 7 star accommodations, services, and dining. I will defiantly stay their when visiting Zurich next time. The overall hotel is ideal for business traveler as well for family. Highly recommended when visiting such beautiful city and people."
"Baur au Lac",,"A beautiful experience","I was happy to return to the Baur au Lac after my visits in the 70's and 80's which have remained vivid memories after 30 years not only because of the hotel itself but because of the things that happened here. The hospitality exceeded my memories in every way, from the greeting to the champagne and flowers that awaited us in the room. I had ordered the flowers but was not charged for them. We were royally served in Le Hall where we enjoyed a light dinner and drinks, feeling as if we were in the center of the civilized world: artists, models, business people; a real scene, and we were part of it. Early the next morning, which was a Sunday, we were the only guests in the Pavilion for breakfast. The beautiful young waitress delighted us with freshly-squeezed pineapple"
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury in all details! Classic design with a modern twist. This is a true leading hotel!","What a view. The hotel is set in his own park and has unique views over the lake and Alps. From the hotel everything is at walking distance, so a great place to discover Zurich. New is 'Le Hall' the beautifull re-opened lounge, a great place to crash or to have a high-tea. The rooms are spacious and feel like new. Highly recommended!!!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Best in the world?","I've been visiting this hotel a couple of times per year for the last dozen years. It is far above any other hotel I've ever visited. The hotel is expensive but much inside is free ie WIFI, Mini-bar etc etc. The gym is mainly for the occasional business traveller and is quite small, but the view out of the window over Lake Zurich is very nice. The breakfast buffet gets 10/10. Just remember that the clothing requirements in all the restaurants is semi-formal so no shorts etc."
"Baur au Lac",,"Normal service resumed, almost!","It is a while since I stayed here because I was a bit disappointed by a few things last time but I am glad that I returned as most things seemed back to normal. A pleasant greeting when I arrived and a welcome back. A truly delicious lunch in Rive Gauche with attentive knowledgeable staff. Special mention must go to the pastry chef who made the warm fig tart with Armagnac ice cream. Super crispy thin pastry, so delicious. Still the same small but perfectly formed room. Everything spotless and fresh looking. This time it was possible to have the air conditioning working but for me it is too noisy to sleep with it on. The rooms are too hot for me but there were doors which open wide and let plenty of cool air in. Unfortunately this time there were some major building and road"
"Baur au Lac",,"La Grande Dame","This hotel is all about service. Everyone is efficient, friendly and attentive. A model of Swiss hospitality. I am extremely impressed with how professional everyone is whether in the restaurants or in the reception area. The rooms are comfortable and spacious. Dated but well maintained."
"Baur au Lac",,"classic luxury","Superb hotel living up to its reputation. Excellent service, conveniently located. I had one of their large rooms on the first floor at the back of the building. Insulation from the road was perfect, bedding sheets pillow all good, large bathroom. Breakfast in the elegant Pavillon room is worth taking. Overall this classic landmark boasts a fresh feel. Hope to return."
"Baur au Lac",,"High class and very cosy","Had the great experience of staying here recently. The hotel is very accommodating and high class. The bar and lounge area were particularly comfortable for a night cap before bed. Not cheap but nothing is in Switzerland but worth the money."
"Baur au Lac",,"An. Extraordinary hotel.","The Baur Au Lac continues to be among the great hotels of the world. Their services and dining are great. They have a wonderful location. They are expensive, as is everything in Switzerland, but we'll worth it in my opinion. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Swiss hotelery at its very best","This is probably one of the best city hotels in the world, true to the very highest standards of excellence. The fact that the hotel has been in the same family for generations certainly enhances this feeling even more. This experience begins with the impeccable doorman, the friendly receptions do staff all over and the very comfortably and cosy rooms. Perfect breakfast buffet and very nice ambiance in the grand hall where one can relax and enjoy a glass of wine in a comfortable armchair. Definitely a hotel to recommend for the business traveler and tourists wanting to enjoy the many things Zurich can offer."
"Baur au Lac",,"View from the gym","We are privileged to stay at wonderful hotels all over the world and we love doing so. The first place I head after unpacking is the hotel gym as that is where I unload the stress of travel. I have spent many hours in hotel gyms all over the world, so when I encounter an extraordinary one I remember it. The Baur au Lac is simply a perfect hotel in every category: location, room decor, cleanliness, attentiveness of staff, food, and ambiance, but the gym puts it over the top. We were there in January during a snowstorm and I ran on a treadmill in the rooftop gym surrounded by swirling snow and wonderful, snow covered city views. I was in heaven. It's definitely not the fanciest gym in the world but you can't beat the view. My husband and I felt cared for in this hotel in a very"
"Baur au Lac",,"One of the Great Hotels of Europe","The Swiss practically invented hospitality as we all know, and Americans come here to university to learn the noble art of the hotelier. This is not to say that all Swiss hotels practice this art equally. A few fall woefully short of the mark. But not the Baur au Lac. This exquisite jewel of a hotel sets a standard few can match. The interior design is elegant but not over the top. Sophisticated, with a blend of old world and and more modern elegance. The staff, everyone I met, was delightful. Friendly without a trace of the hauteur we encountered elsewhere on this trip. Our suite overlooked the garden and the lake with a balcony and the stunning decor could have been ripped from the pages of Architectural Digest on a good day. My wife reminds me of the gym on the top floor, all"
"Baur au Lac",,"Delightful Hotel","Stayed here last year as a stopover in Zurich , and this is a really beautiful hotel . Truly like osmoses home opened up to guests, and real luxury in all the fine details. Service is highly professional and if you stay here you will return again"
"Baur au Lac",,"Maybe Best Hotel in Europe","Didn't know that I would end up at the Hotel Baur au Lac in Zurich, but bad weather conditions forced me to stay in Zurich. It turned out it was the best idea. When checking in late at night the staff was absulutly wonderful. Had the great pleasure to be third guest staying in new lavishly refurbished room. The bed and linen was a amazing, the bathroom very spacious and with a great window. Stunning furniture and great tase. Actually one always says ""I felt like home"" but it felt like paradise. Now I want change home. When asking next morning (Monday) for Sunday newspaper which is never possible - nowhere. To my big surprise the very friendly lady at the kiosk ask me which one? ""I always keep some newspaper from the day before just in case that a guest ask for them."" What a"
"Baur au Lac",,"Lovely Swiss hotel in the perfect location.","My husband stayed at the Baur Au Lac more than 20 years ago and remembered this hotel fondly. We were not sure what to expect after so many years, but were delighted with the updates to the hotel, particularly the beautiful and elegant rooms. The service was impeccable. Breakfast in the pavilion was a lovely way to start the day. Perfect location by the Lake. Will definitely return."
"Baur au Lac",,"Classic Luxury Hotel","We spent two nights in this charm hotel. from the time of the check-in you feel a'coming home' ambiance. large, comfortable rooms with plendid sheets and good pillows in bed. I like to sleep in 68F despite the winter and had no problem with the a / c. dined at both restaurants: In ""The Pavillion"" very classic and elegant roundabout with a nice view of the river, we were very well attended by Austrian Maitre who recommended a magnificent white wine from Vienna (pictured). In this same hall breakfast is served; splendid with day-view of the river. The other night we have dinner in more casual and modern ""Rive Gauche"". We enjoyed having tea and chocolate at the Atrium. overall the atmosphere is elegant, classic and tasteful."
"Baur au Lac",,"I would live here.","Amazing hotel staff and concierge services under Captain Jeremy's leadership, everything can be taken care of for you. Always do the breakfast to start your day. No better location in Zurich. Beautifully updated lobby. Hair and makeup at Vanity is a must. I love Louisa! "
"Baur au Lac",,"Fabulous!"," Famous. Classic. Well located. Is there anything else to say? The reception counter is tiny. But works. There is no lobby to speak of but having said that the atrium is unique The rooms are large and beautiful in the classic European grand hotel style. Technology requirements are discreetly located but all there. The bathroom is luxurious. There is nothing to fault. Perhaps the TV could have a better screen size and quality? The Rive Gauche restaurant where I had dinner is a contrast in style. It exudes modern sophisticated elegance. The menu is worded in a fun fashion. The food is excellent. As is the service. Breakfast is served at Pavillon. What an elegant place for breakfast! The buffet was small. But everything you really need is there. With quality. The ambiance is"
"Baur au Lac",,"Exceptional in every way","found through LHW website, first time to Switzerland so wasn't sure what to expect culture wise - this hotel surpassed all our expectations of 5 star, and more! Every sector, from check in to restaurants to housekeeping were consistent in their outstanding hospitality Would highly recommend for an amazing experience in Zurich"
"Baur au Lac",,"I stayed only one day at this hotel, so this is just a first impression:","I was very favourably impressed. The hotel is very centrally located, with the high street, Bahnhofstrasse, mere minutes away. I had a very lovely room – including a bathroom with a shower that worked fine without you having to study a manual first. The service at the hotel was excellent, as was breakfast. Everything just went fine. Next time I'm in Zurich, I'll be staying at this hotel again."
"Baur au Lac",,"Jewel in Crown of Switzerland","Magnificent old world charm with superb service and attention to detail. Rooms much better than entranxe. Tasteful contemporary decor with sophicticated co fort. Exquisitely clean bathrooms and nice touches. Free mini bar, chocolates and fruit complementary. Very comfortable beds with beautiful linen and crisp soft pillows . Hotel constantly revamps and redecorates. Not to be missed"
"Baur au Lac",,"A jewel in Zurich","We missed our flight from Zurich and resorted to searching online for hotels in Zurich and called a few friends & family members. We lucked out. Having visited most other 5 star hotels in Zurich, we definitely lucked out. 2 mins from Bahnhofstrasse, an amazing lobby lounge with an amazing selection of delicious food, champagnes, liqueurs etc., an amazing evening bar Rive Gauche, the most helpful reception and concierge who arranged everything we needed, the most spacious, well appointed and equipped interconnecting rooms (we have kids), housekeeping staff who were lightening speed yet light footed and room service equally efficient, impressive given that they were almost full occupancy. We loved this hotel and will only stay here in future, occupancy permitting."
"Baur au Lac",,"One of the best hotel in Zurich","Stayed at Baur au Lac hotel for a few nights and absolutely loved everything of it. The hotel is 5 mins walk from Paradplatz and the lakeside, hiding a little behind its own garden, it's like a paradise within a paradise. The hotel standard from rooms, staff, service, hospitality, food to interior are impeccable. Truly a traditional luxurious hotel with a modern touch."
"Baur au Lac",,"An Enjoyable Stay","We were in Zurich for two nights and loved this place. We thought the room even though of good quality, was a little to expensive compared to other luxury hotels across Europe. As it was decorated in a slightly dated style, but elegant at the same time. We loved the open air bar on the ground floor and would end our day there... Very nice. Overall a nice hotel in a good location."
"Baur au Lac",,"Sensational Hotel","Baur au lac was absolutely amazing. Perfect location. Friendly, helpful staff. Superb food and magnificent furnishings. I only wish I knew I was going to love Zurich as much as I did and stayed longer."
"Baur au Lac",,"Bestest hotel staff ever!","This time visiting this hotel on vacation with the family. With children I needed connected rooms, that was done without asking! Excellent location between Zurich lake and Banhofstasse. Not very far from central station. Clean, renovated and quite. The best feature about this hotel are the staff, not a single grumpy worker, all very helpful and extremely courteous. I would rank this location as the best hotel of the year for me, I have stayed in at least 15 different hotels this year, from Dubai to Las Vegas, this ranks number one."
"Baur au Lac",,"Masterclass","Unless your income means it's a relative insignificance, perhaps no hotel is ever really worth the price one has to pay at hotels such as this. But when it comes to the high-end, exclusive, historic hotels of the world, the Baur au Lac sets the standard. Of course the rooms, while on the smaller side, are wonderfully comfortable and superbly appointed. Breakfast was exquisite and understated with restrained portions from the finest ingredients. But the real stars here are the staff It's a fine art to make a guest feel welcomed and valued as customer without being obsequious - and surely a different balance for every grand dame or trust fund jet-setter - but concierge, waiters, store clerks et al manage it to a T. Management of any leading hotel would do themselves a favour by"

"Baur au Lac",,"Truly Top Class Experience!","I have stayed in luxury hotels worldwide and Baur au Lac was truly incredible! It was my birthday the day of arrival and they had put a complementary fruit basket and INCREDIBLE chocolate torte birthday cake to welcome me in the room. Every staff member in the hotel wished me a happy birthday every time I would go in and out. baur au Lac truly was about the details. The in house bar was lovely. The rooms were HUGE by European standards and I wanted to take the beautiful bathrooms with headed marble floors home with me. An all around amazing hotel experience with impeccable service. Not to mention the stellar location on the lake with lovely views of the Alps. Will return this summer. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent hotel, probably one of the best hotels of the world!","Baur Au Lac in Zurich is an excellent hotel and probably one of the best hotels all over the world, as far as I know!

"Baur au Lac",,"Perfect stay","My 2-day stay at the Baur au Lac with 2 children aged 8 and 4 1/2 was just perfect. The room was huge and tastefully decorated. I had to ask for some medicine as my daughter was unwell, and it was fetched from the local pharmacy and promptly delivered to our room. My son had received a stuffed lion during an earlier stay at the hotel, and this time it was elephants! When the very nice lady from housekeeping heard that there was a third child at home she very kindly asked whether we wished a third one - which of course we did as it was so gracefully proposed. All members of the staff were incredibly nice and helpful, with a special mention for the maitre d'hôtel at le Pavilllon restaurant who took care of our breakfast as if we were the only or the most important guests in the"
"Baur au Lac",,"Absolutely Fabulous","We have just spent three glorious days in this wonderful Hotel...no wonder it's amongst the Leading Hotels in the world category and deservedly so. I doubt whether any reviewer could adequately articulate the all round splendour from the moment you see the courtyard entrance and you are whisked to your de luxe room with the minimum hassle and optimum efficiency. Then the luxury of 423 unfolds in front of your delighted eyes. Beautifully and tastefully decorated with all creature comforts in abundance and a bathroom and walk in shower which was equally top class, including underfloor heating! (Mustn't forget either the complimentary mini bar either and the electronically controlled blinds.) What about the staff....well from the opening greeting to the Auf wiedersehn absolutely"
"Baur au Lac",,"A perfect hotel","A classic with wonderful accommodation and excellent service. A must stay if you plan on citing the city. It is one of my favorite hotels in Switzerland and has been constant in perfection every since my first visit twenty years ago. Highly recommended for a vacation."
"Baur au Lac",,"A gem near the lake in the heart of Zurich","For starters, Baur au Lac is perfectly located in Zurich. It is within walking distance of several of the major attractions (churches, art museum) and is right on the lake. The hotel is beautifully maintained, the staff are very accommodating and knowledgeable and my room was well appointed and very quiet and comfortable. I was in Zurich for just one night on the way to Kenya from the United States, so I had very little time to explore the city and fully enjoy the hotel, but I was able to walk to the Kunsthaus Art Museum and enjoy the special exhibition and permanent collection, see the Marc Chagall stained glass windows at the Fraumunster, enjoy lunch at a little outdoor cafe, explore the old town sectionof the city and have a drink back at the hotel in the lovely outdoor"
"Baur au Lac",,"Traditional","This hotel has the traditional touch with elegance and service of the old school but with modern equipment. I really recommend it if you are in business in Zurich. I stayed in the top floor in a Junior Suite, a lot of space in all the room, but a great walking closet and a huge bathroom."
"Baur au Lac",,"Four day Break in Zurich","This is a truly wonderful hotel, to take a break in and recover since it provides you with everything that the 5* hotel should i.e excellant location, 5* service in a beautiful and elegant surroundings. The hotel proximity to Banhoff strasse makes for easy shopping and access to bars and restaurants but before you venture outside you must try hotel's restaurants - the food and service is first class. This hotel is for somebody that expects and values high standards"
"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic","This has to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out. Perfection. Atmosphere is fabulous, the attention to detail superb. Food excellent, service superb. I love this hotel and will definitely be returning."
"Baur au Lac",,"A luxurious hotel with an attitude","Stay there on the end of September 2014, as it was my first visit to Zurich. Locatedbin prime location, walking distance to shopping places and cafes, also just across the Lake Cruise Pier. Make our trip memorable with many activities. The room interior so luxurious in design and full with all amenities. The room furnitures and a clean beatiful bathroom. I also put a high salute with their staff, their welcome and warm attitude make us felt special. Star from a helpful Doormen to Concierge and Reception. My special thanks to Mr. Khumar-Housekeeoing."
"Baur au Lac",,"Old world charm with fine dining","You can feel the luxury in the air at the Baur au Lac - it is beautiful, traditional, no surprises and very refined. The location is perfect and a special spot to dine al fresco. The menu does not disappoint and the food is excellent."
"Baur au Lac",,"Old","Smell in the corridors, everything in the room seems old, air conditioning is very noisy, seems being installed 20 years ago. Really needs renovation. Service is not ideal. Bad value for money.i arrived at 16-00 and my room was not ready. Breakfast is ok, but not included in the rate. And cost 46 franks."
"Baur au Lac",,"Best hotel in Zurich","Very expensive but nothing else even compares, excellent service gorgeous restaurant wonderful location for breakfast and one can walk to wherever one wants . Switzerland's best and greatest city always a treat to visit . Concierge amongst the best I have found anywhere and always ready to help in any situation . Highly recommend if you can afford such an expensive hotel in what is already one of the worlds most expensive cities . "
"Baur au Lac",,"Charming Classic","Carefully upgraded old-style classic hotel. The beautifully upgraded bathrooms grab your attention, a refreshing change from corner-cutting modernizations you see all to often. Breakfast at the Pavilion is a treat. Top class service, wow eggs benedict. I even think they've earned a Michelin star. The Mediterranean restaurant on the other side is terrific too. Awkward access, down and up, but definitely worth the visit. Don't miss a Henricks n tonic at the bar, with cucumber, and, unconventionally, black pepper! Location to die for, at the lake end of Banhofstrasse....perfect for business or pleasure."
"Baur au Lac",,"Nice hotel, very good service","My husband and I stayed there for 3 nights. All hotel staff we met were friendly and gave us warm greetings. Our suite was nicely decorated and clean. We also dined in their Michelin star restaurant Pavillon, very nice food and as usual, friendly staff with good service. Overall, it's a very nice experience. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Great hotel","Excellent and luxury hotel. Located in front of the lake and just two blocks from Banhnofstrasse, the main downtown and exclusive shopping street. All the salons of the hotel are clear, with beautiful design and elegant decoration, specially the breakfast room and the outdoor restaurante, with the wonderful hotel garden view. The rooms are very comfortable and beautiful too, the concern about perfection and details is in everything. The quality of the service and the attention to the guest requests are the highest and the best my family ( 12 persons), have experienced at a hotel of the group of hotels "" The Leading Hotels of the World"". Everything in the hotel met totally our expectations and the happiness and hospitality of all the hotel team members created an atmosphere that"

"Baur au Lac",,"Zurich Institution","Baur Au Lac is iconic Zurich hotel, perfectly located within short walk to the midst of action. It's been relatively recently updated so you'd find that whilst retaining its Old World feel it is very comfortable. Magnificent breakfast. In Zurich I have two favourite hotels: Dolder Grand and Baur au Lac, very different. Choose one or the other dependent on the location you prefer. (if on business Baur Au Lac central Zurich location is more convenient, if on holiday and need great facilities, hikes etc or don't mind the 20 min drive - Dolder)."
"Baur au Lac",,"By far the best hotel in Zurich","Being a frequent traveller - I would like to recommend Baur au Lac to any demanding person - this hotel has everything. Great restaurant, beautiful terrace, nice bar and large quiet rooms as well as a top service."
"Baur au Lac",,"What a delight!!!","I stayed for one night at the Baur au Lac at the end of June. I had been searching for a hotel on various hotel websites and was astonished, even horrified how bad the Zurich hotel scene is. Extremely expensive hotels - above Paris and London levels - and horrible design and decoration including the old world hotels and the big chains. The Baur au Lac was essentially the only hotel which instantly attracted my attention. I have admit, I was a bit concerned what could I expect but my stay there was in any respect simply a delight. We had an early arrival after an overnight flight coming from Delhi, hence we required an early check in....which we obtained. Staff was utmost friendly and helpful. We were offered a room facing the courtyard which was not what I initially"
"Baur au Lac",,"Superb Service","Expensive, but we had a beautiful room, great service, real old world class hotel. Location is at the end of Bahnhofstrasse, close to the lake and the boat landing. We couldn't make our WiFi work at first, and within minutes an IT professional came to our room to set it up for us."
"Baur au Lac",,"Lux rooms only","Very comfy rooms, room service and food is good but that's all , the location is ok although a bit far from the shopping area but it's a nice walk, the thing is that the lobby or coffee shop etc in the hotel are so cold and not inviting but the stay I mean sleeping in is the best you can get"
"Baur au Lac",,"A Wonderful Experience","We were in Zurich for 3 days for my son's wedding and stayed at the Baur au Lac. It is a spectacular property - beautiful, fantastic location, great food and exceptional service. I can't imagine staying anywhere else if I return to Zurich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Maybe too formal and far too expensive for what you get","This was our last stop on a fabulous multi-city trip through Europe. Arrived on a Saturday to depart on Monday morning back to the states. I read the reviews and was hoping for a fabulous stay in Zurich. I have never felt so ripped off upon leaving a hotel. To say this hotel is expensive is an understatement. First this hotel does have a great location for walking around Old Town and some scenic churches right across from Lake Zurich. But actually you cannot see the lake from the hotel unless you are in one of the very few expensive rooms in the front of hotel on the top floor. The room we were given was in the very back of the hotel, and the hotel was virtually empty! It was totally dead, maybe they had 10 rooms occupied. So we had a view of the back streets. The hotel feels so"
"Baur au Lac",,"Impeccable","Formal yet friendly service. Great location. Fine spacious rooms n baths. Pretty gardens. Had a great time in all Visited w the family n though the surrounds were rather grand we felt welcomed tho our young kids were their usual boisterous selves, running through the grounds w no shoes. They were scruffy but well respected as little guests, n I really appreciated that ! "
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazingly Fantastic!","Visited recently on our drive through Switzerland. I wish I would have stayed more than one night. Absolutely blew my wife away. Sooo romantic. She didn't want to leave. Room overlooking the canal on about the 4th floor. Had all the old world charm you'd expect traveling in luxury through Zurich. Very much the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Service staff was more than accommodating at every whim. Breakfast was fantastic in a beautiful setting. We will be back to Zurich if only for the Baur au lac!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Worth every penny!","While researching hotels in Zurich, the Baur au Lac seemed to land near the top of every list I could find. Now I know why. It is simply one of the best hotels we have every had the pleasure at which to stay. Everything about our stay was simply superb. We arrived early from the US, but the staff was able to show us to our room very quickly. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary, and were fortunate enough to have been given a lovely upgrade to a city suite, with a large bedroom and separate, equally spacious living room. The bathroom was positively palatial, with white marble and sparkling chrome everywhere, and a beautiful, large soaking tub. The bed was very comfortable, with soft, beautiful linens. We were treated like royalty, from the sumptuous spread of"
"Baur au Lac",,"5 Star Dinner","We had high expectations and the dinner in no way disappointed . This is a special place and needs to be enjoyed by fully accepting the special way in which the staff treat their customers. Never before have I experienced such professional and dedicated service. The detailed knowledge of our waiter on all dishes and wines was just unquestionable and the TLC that he afforded us remarkable . The food did not disappoint , and included asparagus starters , grilled veal and veal and mushrooms for main followed by season strawberries and a cheese dessert. All dishes were impeccably presented and prepared just perfectly. This is a quality fine dining restaurant and one should therefore expect to pay the appropriate price. Highly recommended . "
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful Hotel, stunning service, great location","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Baur au Lac. From being greeted at the front door, to the person whose job it is to gently rotate the revolving door at the perfect speed for you, the the incredibly helpful concierge who greeted you by name and helped with everything - this is an absolute first class hotel. Easily the best service we had in Paris, Nice, Monte Carlo, Vaduz, Switzerland, London, Venice, Rome - I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point - this place is special. The beds are incredibly comfortable, and the pillow menu allowed us to fine tune our sleep. Make sure to ask for that upon arrival. The mini-bar is free (which every 5 star hotel should do - make that every hotel). All the little touches in the hotel were great. A nice sitting area for drinks"
"Baur au Lac",,"Love this hotel","This is a very beautiful hotel with amazing (but very expensive) restaurants. I love the gym - had everything I needed and was clean and empty. Love that everything in the mini bar is free. Love the bedding and towels. Our room was beautiful. Staff was so nice. Enjoyed every meal I ate here."
"Baur au Lac",,"Highly recommended","Have just spent 1 night here. Wonderful place. Staff very friendly and relaxed. Comfortable rooms with excellent housekeeping. Breakfast is the best I have ever had in a hotel - delicious fruit; wonderful bakery selection. Expensive, of course, but in this case you really do get what you pay for."
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful","We recently stayed at the Baur au Lac in Zurich [3 rooms, 6 guests] for 5 days, as part of a longer holiday. After flying in from the United States we arrived in the early morning and even in our tired, disheveled appearance, every single employee greeted us with a warm hello and a smile. What’s more they worked to get us into our suites almost immediately so we could get some rest and begin enjoying our fantastic stay in Zurich and all of Switzerland. The hotel itself is wonderful, it is old school, European luxury. From stained glass, heated bathroom floors, fresh flowers, stocked [complimentary] bar, and afternoon treats in the room. But what is even more important to us, are the content and gracious employees. Every single one, from Bell Captain to Valet, Room Service"
"Baur au Lac",,"Unglaublich","My wife and myself stayed at the hotel for only one night we had in Zurich, yet we wished we have lost out Passports and stay there forever... Maybe the nicest hotel we ever stayed in our life, with amazing staff so helpful and freindly. We will sure come back for longer stay very soon. Thank you"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great location, good food, friendly staff","I have to say that, being close to the lake, as well as to the Bahnhofstrasse, this hotel is probably the best located luxury property in Zurich. Even if its entrance hall and bar may look outdated, the rest of the property looks great (plus, don't let that fool you, both the inside bar and the adjunct bar/restaurant Rive Gauche serve great drinks. Also, both restaurants (Rive Gauche and Pavillon) serve great food (even if rather pricey), and the room service is not bad, either. The staff is very friendly, and the rooms are pretty large. Be aware, though, that not all rooms are renovated. My parents have deliberately requested the old fashion room for some reason (my fiancé and I stayed in a new one), and it was just as good as the renovated one, except the decor was a lot less"
"Baur au Lac",,"Tasteful luxury!","After 10 days in a small apartment in Paris, we checked into the Hotel Baur au Lac for 2 nights on our 35 day Europe trip. It was fabulous! We had a lovely suite, with wonderful linens, and a beautifully appointed bathroom. There was room to spread out and be very comfortable and the mattress was also very comfortable! All of the concierge persons were warm and helpful, as were the front desk persons, who were very welcoming! Although we did not choose to have dinner at the hotel restaurant, (the concierge recommended two marvelous restaurants that we enjoyed!) we did have breakfast there every morning. It was also wonderful.....many beautiful choices on the buffet and hot choices made fresh in the kitchen. We couldn't have asked for more! "
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxurious pampering","Service was top notch. Felt very welcome when we first stepped in the door. Member of Leading Hotels so I was given an upgrade to a suite. Great view and amenities. Bathroom was huge and well appointed. Only complaint is the shampoo and conditioner in one bottle. I always bring my own conditioner since this hotel product doesn't condition my hair well. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel so quiet. Definitely a good night's sleep! Small breakfast buffet compared to other hotels but the staff will get anything you desire in addition to the buffet. Dinner was absolutely fabulous and the chef surprises a marvelous treat and opportunity to taste a variety of special dishes. Concierge was most helpful in suggesting activities while we were there and making sure we got where"
"Baur au Lac",,"Annual company dinner","We spent a long night at the Baur Au Lac's main dining hall, entirely reserved for the annual company dinner (around 100 people). We were extremely well catered for, obviously it's not an easy thing to accommodate that amount of guests on a non-buffet menu, and I have to say the quality was top-notch. The ambience and decor are decidedly classy, and the access to the smoking lounge was a nice touch - in freezing December weather. Service was very good, considering the time it lasted, and the increasing tipsyness of the guests, staff behaved with the utmost discretion and efficiency. Only a 5* superior establishment can avail itself of such a high class of service, quality of food, and style - there is little doubt in my mind that staying overnight here (if you can afford it!)"
"Baur au Lac",,"A world's Best","The Baur au Lac is a gem. From the second you arrive, you feel pampered and treated as a Royal family member. The service is perfect and ran with maestria. I love this hotel and cannot recommend it enough. We had dinner at Rive Gauche as we stayed only for one night during this holiday weekend. The food was delicious and the service efficient and courteous. The room was very nicely decorated and the hotel offers complimentary mini bar, internet service. I certainly will be back on my next stay in Zürich. The Baur au Lac is the place to stay if you are looking for a five stars perfection."
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful but not five star","This is a beautiful hotel, and I was well received on arrival. I was shown to an immaculate single room with lovely crisp bedlinen and a nice decor. There was a fruit basket in the room. Both the bathroom and the room were spacious, but there was no view. My room was facing another bulding. I did not mind, but it might be worth asking for a view if that is important to you. I found the hotel to be very quiet and I had a good night's sleep.The reason I won't rate the hotel as five star is because there were a few shortcomings and I expected everything to be perfect in this beautiful hotel. Firstly the food which was average. I ordered a croque Monsieur as a snack, and I received just that. A sad looking toast on it's own on a plate. There was no garnish of any kind such as for"
"Baur au Lac",,"Lovely old style","I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel, excellent and professional service. The Brasserie style restaurant was perhaps not up to the level, despite great food the service was somewhat slack. I still think it's sad when a hotel uses it's standard rooms even when it isn't full, looking out the window into the courtyard always is a drag....Despite a huge bathroom and lovely room per say. Alos strange that depsite 2-3 weeks of spring with warm temperatures and blue skies, there was no terrace open so no place to sit outside to enjoy the day, had to leave the hotel. Conference facilities were 100%, impeccable service and outsnading catering - do NOT miss the home made birchermuesli! :)"
"Baur au Lac",,"Over the top Service and style","I had two recent stays at this hotel. Its quiet elegance, location, and perfect service make it one of my favorite stays in the world. On my last evening before an early flight, I left my credit card at a restaurant. I had to cancel the card early the next morning. On checking out, the staff could not have been more helpful, advancing me some extra travel money, and telling me to just email them the new credit card number when I arrived home. This sort of kindness and trust is not often experienced these days. Home now, but I find myself longing for that perfect quiet, airy breakfast experience in the Pavillion restaurant. My friends and I are planning our next euro-ski-adventure around a stay at the Baur au Lac. It's that good."
"Baur au Lac",,"A lakeside gem in Zurich","I have recently had the opportunity of returning to the Baur Au Lac after my first visit nearly twenty five years ago. The hotel is still the grand gem in Zurich. Service is perfect , rooms are absolutely beautiful and the food , whether in the Breakfast restaurant or the hall is top standard. Location could not be better, walking distance to shops , and of course around the lovely lake. The hotel is a showcase of Swiss hotel perfection. Do visit and enjoy the experience. Marc M, Victoria, Australia."
"Baur au Lac",,"Unashamed Luxury","Difficult to review this hotel - it is just perfect in every respect. Attentive service yet not obsequious, incredible large rooms with extraordinarily comfortable beds, superb bathroom facilities, first class breakfast and so on and so on. There is not a single thing that could be improved upon. Affiliated to the 'Leading Hotels of the World' the Baur au Lac leads the way. Of course, it is not cheap........."
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful lake view","Amazing place...very nice the garden during the summer...beautiful decorated little tearoom....very helpfull and friendly staff. The food is very tasty and well served. Very popular place for the elderly and beautiful aristocrats...."
"Baur au Lac",,"one of the best","This hotel is my faworit during long time already. It is one of the best hotels in Europe and believe me I visited really many hotels already, mostly members of The Leading Hotels of the World. Baur Au Lack - the best service, rooms, restaurans, location... I can recomend you!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent place","Classy hotel! Stayed for 3 nights in a spacious room with lake view during the Golden League, friendly stuff always helpful, great food quality. Only missed the chance to be driven in the hotel´s Rolls Royce;-)"
"Baur au Lac",,"Swiss service!","Me and my girlfriend went there to have a lunch and it was very good experience. Service staff was very friendly and food quality was good. Nice view! They also serve very good brunch on weekends! Suggest everyone to try !"
"Baur au Lac",,"Up to expectations","We stayed 3 nights at the Baur Au Lac and had in overall a satisfied stay. Staff: The staff at the hotel was very helpful and always of assistance. I would like to thank all of them. Room We (2 adults, two kids, 8-year old & 15 month-old) stayed in a Junior suite. Although we hoped for a lake view room, the room amendments made up the lack of the view. The bed was very comfortable and the room was large enough for all of us and the baby cod we brought. We had a good sleep as it was very quite in the nights. The room was on the top floor and was good for venting the room with fresh air during the day. The bath was very comfortable. However, we wished it could be aerated as well. We were amazed at the minibar which was included in the price and refilled every day. Access to the"
"Baur au Lac",,"Over rated 5 star hotel","Unquestionably the hotel is well located in the heart of Zurich and the hotel itself is nothing short of spectacular, but that's where it ends. If your looking for a 5 star hotel with bragging rights well located in Zurich, then this will do fine. If, as like myself, you expect a warm reception on check-in, a helpful concierge, the front door to be opened by the staff member attending the door or even the staff you bump into in the hallway to greet you warmly, then this isn't the hotel for you. This hotel doesn't have a swimming pool or decent gym, so it should at least make up with exceptional service, sadly not. The service at this hotel pales into insignificance compared to the likes of the Mandarin Oriental or even the Park Hyatt. Mini bars are complimentary and the hotel is"
"Baur au Lac",,"Par excellence","This was a hotel of the highest calibre, the staff were extremely polite & helpful & the service was outstanding. We dined in the Pavillion restaurant. The food was delicate & full of flavour as was the food we found in the bistro the next day. Rooms were of a good size,extremely comfortable, quiet & well thought out with every attention to detail. We are hoteliers so are extremely critical but we were hard pushed to fault it. A job well done!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Well, the Swiss invented the hotel industry","I'd wanted to stay here for years, but never felt I could justify the price. Finally decided to splurge for our anniversary trip, and am so glad we did. This property is everything one wants a hotel to be: terrific location, knowledgeable concierges(hat tip especially, to Marius), wonderful breakfasts(we didn't eat any other meals there), quiet, comfortable bed(well, it IS Switzerland, after all!) beautiful room with fireplace, outstanding bathroom, and I could go on…the fact that a bottle of lovely champagne magically appeared on the day of our anniversary didn't hurt,either ;-)"
"Baur au Lac",,"Like the Curate's egg","This is a hard one, like the ""Curate's egg"", this is ""Good in parts"". The Swiss are renowned for their politeness, cleanliness, correctness, honesty and for watching the bottom line, essential in any business. Zurich is a major world city, even though it has a small population. Amazingly, hotels in Zurich are well below modern standards, because they are old, outdated and badly in need of upgrading and modernization. This is the problem with the Baur au Lac. The best location on the lake, gorgeous entrance & foyer, but the rooms, although large are dowdy and very ancient. The staff are, as you would expect in Switzerland, outstanding. Put together, the prices reflect past glory, not today's value reality. But the next tier down suffer even more. Zurich badly needs a modern"
"Baur au Lac",,"They don't take food allergies serious!!","We were at the Baur au lac on the occasion of a ball, so experienced only F&B. The food was less than average, but what's really worrying is that they brought my husband a dessert plate (knowing well about his allergies to nuts!). When I looked at the plate with among others a chocolate cake and crushed nuts on it, I told my husband to better double check. The maître d' came back from the kitchen a moment later with the same plate saying it was alright for him to eat as there were no nuts on or in the food. Thankfully, we convinced my husband not to eat any of it because it was obvious that there were nuts on as well as in the cake. Sure enough a few minutes later the maitre d' comes back to say just that. I find it unacceptable that in a five star place, they do not take"
"Baur au Lac",,"As Expected","Nice, spotless rooms. Comfortable bed, bathroom & shower were great. The fitness centre is small with limited equipment & it's a shame there is no pool. Reception staff was very helpful & friendly. Perfect location for shopping & sightseeing."
"Baur au Lac",,"Old men don't forget - always impeccable comfort and service","It is quite an achievement to keep the standard I was told about by my grandparents and be able now to tell my own grandchildren the same. On the other hand a critical mind of a repeat guest also observes changes, redecorations and the slacks in service (if there were any). After many visits; you have never let us down in our expectations. The friendly reception and easy communication with all the helpful staff is what counts. Impeccable five star performance; rooms, beds, bathrooms and this time particularly, I have to praise the kitchen for an outstanding dinner in the Pavillion restaurant. In no other hotel can my wife and I be so sure that comfort and best of service will be guaranteed from the moment we enter. Is it dull? Maybe a little but not the food and the views and"
"Baur au Lac",,"The best hotel in Swiss.","I was stay to the hotel last weekend. The service, the personnel and the rooms was fantastic. I try also the restaurant and was in a top level, food and service outstanding. Continue the great job. I will go back for sure. "
"Baur au Lac",,"A rare find Truly 5 star","The staff are friendly and helpful.The decor and rooms are sublimely superior. The decor and ambience peaceful and elegant….The proximity to the Bahnhoffstrasse only a short walk.Also,close to the tram that runs along this road…The garden setting to have sundowners or a meal in summer..serene and beautiful….popular for local trendsetters…However, this hotel is expensive but you get what you pay for….the bar fridge in the room is complimentary…which I thought to be a nice touch…we stayed in a junior suite….."
"Baur au Lac",,"Top End Luxury","Baur Au Lac is an institution in Zurich and one of the places I have stayed at with parents and family for the last 25 years. On par with the best Top End hotels of Europe or New York it is the place for some serious luxury. Quite expensive but worth it if you have the cash, another hotel oozing old world charm."
"Baur au Lac",,"TOP NOTCH!","I held a company event at this hotel the end of October. As an Event Planner I am very particular with venues. This place is top notch. The service is amazing. My first presenter ran over and we had to rearrange the schedule a bit. They immediately were able to accommodate our new schedule as our lunch was pushed back a few minutes. The wait staff was pleasant, kind, and very attentive! I could not be happier and would definitely return. Only negative, I had some trouble getting access to the internet, but I also did not ask for help so that was half of the problem :)"
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful Hotel","Just few minutes’ away from the Paradeplatz financial district and the Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich’s celebrated shopping high street, the hotel enjoys a unique location overlooking the lake and the Alps. To try the tuna steak they serve at the restaurant ""Rive Gauche"". Beautiful the ambience and the excellent food you find in the other restaurant of the hotel, ""The Pavillion"". If you want to live a unique experience in Zurich in one of the place that is part of the best leading hotels in the world for something like 170 years, you should consider the Baur au Lac."
"Baur au Lac",,"A great hotel with style and service","First time there, this is a gracious old hotel with impeccable service from staff who attend to every detail. Rooms were excellent, shower was 10 out of 10 and the free mini bar was a bonus. Perhaps breakfast could have been included for that price and a multiple night stay. Many fantasic restaurants within 500 to 700 metres, excellent shopping of course. Minor complaint, it took ten minutes for a taxi to arrive we we walked out early in the morning (before rush hour)"
"Baur au Lac",,"A lot of purple in this Restaurant le Pavillon","We were invited today in the Pavillon at the Hotel Baur au Lac in Zurich newly redone. Fresh looking but very purple. We took something from the business menu which ended up to be very expensive. We had no wine and only one course but everything we had was exellent but overprized. A lot of German waiters nothing to complain about the service but not charming. A pitty it could be different."
"Baur au Lac",,"Still the gold standard","I'd last been to Baur au Lac in 2002 and was anxious to share what made my top five ever list with my spouse. Despite the curious postings here, thankfully it was the same, if not better. Check in was friendly, gracious and warm. The room was lovely (fresh flowers, heated floors and complimentary mini bar). Our dinner at Pavillon was spectacular. The food (which included what the waiter described as ""surprises"" - wonderful, several, amuse bouche) - was scrumptious as was the wine which was a choice from staff. We had top-notch attention, especially from the outgoing concierge, Jeremie Varry - who sorted through our train ticket scheduling challenge and made the rest of our trip much easier. The Baur au Lac moved up on our list, and for us remains one of the very top"
"Baur au Lac",,"Nicely finished hotel, but choose your room carefully","This is a lovely hotel. Great setting, beautiful grounds and nicely appointed rooms, BUT some of the rooms are quite small. Avoid any room ending in ""41"" as these are narrow rooms - almost claustrophobic, certainly not what you expect at this price. On the plus side, the breakfast buffet is excellent."
"Baur au Lac",,"Good but lack of character","We mainly chose Baur au Lac it for its excellent location, and while the hotel indeed is very good, it somehow lacks character. There are tons of 5 star hotels like this, so nothing special about Baur au Lac. It was also a surprise that the breakfast was not included in the room rate. Me and my partner both had one croissant at the breakfast and ended up paying almost 100 CHF for it (full buffet price) – not too impressed. Recommended for business travellers, couples or families go somewhere else."
"Baur au Lac",,"Don't stay here even for FREE.","DON'T EVEN STAY HERE for FREE. I stayed at this hotel a few weeks back with my Mother - her first trip to Zurich and I wanted to spoil her by staying at the best hotel in town. Honestly - I have stayed at many luxurious properties which have far superior service. The staff at the front desk are simply rude and cocky. I requested if I could get an upgrade (something special for my Mom and this being hospitality whether people agree OR NOT they tend to smile with their answer). I was talking to the gentleman at the Front Desk while checking in and when I was making my requests - the Front Desk Manager --- snapped at me citing I should not be making requests and even went on to make a noise to eluded that I was making too many requests. All I wanted to do was to spoil my Mother!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Very disappointing without accountability","I am sorry to disagree with the majority of reviewers. I booked a room in January for August and when I arrived, the only room available was in front of a construction site! Although I found the staff to be very nice, nice did not cut it and I checked out the next day. To say ""I am sorry"" again and again and to not solve the problem or try to make it up to me is not acceptable. I actually was well received at the Storchen the next day and would not consider the Baur au Lac ever again. The Widder I hear is the better hotel. Such a disappointing experience!"
"Baur au Lac",,"what an amazing hotel","I travelled in Aug 2013 and stayed for 3 nights. Beautifully situated with lake view, metro arround the corner, beautiful garden and so convienent to go shopping. every one was very friendly, polite and very helpful. I had a painting that I needed to put in a hard tube and asked where was the post office near by, they took the painting and did everything for me at put it in my room. that is what you call is service. breakfast area with fresh flower bouquets was amazing and breakfast was also very good. I would go back to this hotel any time in future if I go to zurich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Will not be my first time here","I booked for room to celebrate my honeymoon. awesome staff kind and helpful, clean room , high class restaurant , located in end of famous road which make even better for me they upgrade my room and offer flower and drink for free I was felt special. For me every time I visit Zurich I will book here "
"Baur au Lac",,"Top","Swiss top quality in service, location, furnishing and restaurant. It has always been the best in the city and due to heavy reinvestments and updating in every aspect maintains its edge. Although the Widder disputes the top rating in Zurich, the better location and the more classical and traditional decoration gives Baur Au Lac, in my opinion, the first place among any other hotel in the city. For discerning travellers who need the very best."
"Baur au Lac",,"No regrets here!","I enjoyed my stay at Baur au Lac very much. The staff at the front desk set a great mood for us after our tiring journey to switzerland. The receptionists always had a smile on their faces which is definitely something to mention. The concierge staff were informative and could answer all the questions I had. A prime location with one of the best breakfast meals I've had at a hotel. I can recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Zurich!!"
"Baur au Lac",,"The best hotel i have ever stayed in!","The Baur is quite simply the best best hotel in which I have stayed, Everything is perfect, The setting the positioning, Decor, Service. All faultless and whilst not at all inexpensive it represents what a luxury hotel should. Its classic decor and sumptuous rooms are firmly set in my mind!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Possibly the best hotel in Zurich","I treated my staff to a Christmas dinner here. As my colleagues came from other country offices, a number of our guys/gals stayed here and without exception all were extremely pleased. The quality of the food in their Michelin restaurant was as expected, exceptional. A colleague had reccomended and he was quite correct.....a heartry and well fed thanks was in order... Rooms are great, location great, service impeccible (if an olde worldy european style - I had jeans and a jacket/shirt and had some difficulty persuading the Manager to allow me to enter the restaurant as i was 'inappropriately' dressed. In any event he relented and I promised to abide by their rules on my next visit) Overall excellent. I have had a number of companies in Switzerland over the years and many"
"Baur au Lac",,"The perfect Swiss hotel","Staying at the Baur au Lac is like driving an old Bentley - a perfectly tuned classic which benefits from all the experience of decades of good living. The staff are really exceptional and deliver a flawless service to their guests. The location is superb and the outside bar/restaurant is a tremendously classy place to dine and pass the evening hours. The rooms are extremely comfortable (despite a surprisingly noisy air conditioning system - Bentley would not tolerate that). What a great place to stay."
"Baur au Lac",,"Always the best","We have been staying in Baur Au Lac now for many years every time we visit Zurich. It is our home away from home.They always take an extra effort to accommodate us in the same room that we have become so used to.The concierge is so kind and fun.And I love their breakfast :) With Baur Au Lac you know you are going the get the best service each time."
"Baur au Lac",,"The epitome of Zurich class","My husband and I had the extreme pleasure of spending a day and a night in Zurich in between travel locations on our 10th wedding anniversary celebration. The hotel is absolutely without fault although such 'faultless' attention to detail does come at a jaw dropping price! We were lucky enough to have been kindly upgraded to a sumptuously appointed suite and marveled at the art and the comfortable bed. The location is absolutely perfect for both business and shopping. The service is attentive but not invasive and nothing was too much trouble. The restaurant at breakfast has to be one of the classiest, most welcoming settings we've ever seen--the orchids and in fact, all of the flowers were breathtaking. My only nit-pic, is that the price for breakfast is ridiculously over the"
"Baur au Lac",,"Terrific hotel; amazing location","We recently stayed at the hotel during the festival that is held every three years in the city. Given the enormous chaos that accompanies these events, the hotel was a quiet oasis literally a few feet from the center of the action. The staff is extremely friendly and well trained and our hotel room was exceptionally well appointed. We also ate at the Rive Gauche restaurant which was quite good. A perfect place to stay in Zurich and we recommned it without qualification."
"Baur au Lac",,"EXCELLENT","Exvellent location, great service, beautiful setting, food is great and you get free wi-fi too. all this comes at a price but very well worth it. very classic hotel, but rooms are very up to date with a nice ambience and very comfortable."
"Baur au Lac",,"Effortless excellence","Every aspect of our stay at Baur al Lac was superb. From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel we were their most important guests, greeting us with genuine smiles, and offering help and information, and doing it all with courtesy and tact. Nothing seemed too much trouble. Every staff member we encountered was knowledgeable, solicitous and genuinely charming. The hotel exudes luxury in the Grand European manner. Our room was glamorous and well appointed, and satisfied every need for a business couple. The king sized bed was comfortable, and the large bathroom contained a separate shower, bath, and bidet. We can recommend all the dining options. We especially enjoyed the all white terrace area facing the private park opposite the Zurichsee for pre or post dinner"
"Baur au Lac",,"Charming wonderfully located traditional hotel","Wonderful service, ideal location, where one is really treated like a guest. Nothing is too much trouble. Despite the old school charm, the rooms are modern, well-equipped and the bathrooms are really thoughtfully designed."
"Baur au Lac",,"Location location location","That's really what you pay for staying here. This is a pretty hotel with some old school charm: multiple doormen who all remember your name and greet you as you walk in or out, no electronic key cards but traditional keys on key holders that you hand to the concierge on your way out of the hotel, decor is predominantly classic throughout - with the exception of the outside terrace and the light and airy breakfast room. Apropos breakfast: let's continue with breakfast. Sadly, it is just OK. And if it is not included in your hotel room charge, it is a small fortune (yikes!!) and thus so not worth it! We have had better breakfasts at boutique hotels and other four star hotels. Please take a stroll and go to nearby lovely cafés and enjoy a more authentic Swiss breakfast for a"
"Baur au Lac",,"Jewel Box of a hotel.","Gorgeous, well maintained hotel. A bit on the stuffy side, but lovely rooms and public areas. Very well located. My one criticism is the bath tub/shower combo was a bust. Water everywhere and I could barely step into the tub without straining myself and I'm a middle aged long legged person. Anyone with short legs or mobility problems would have a tough time with this set up. Yes I would stay there again."
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent, but expensive","Doublessly a top hotel, great location (close to lake and the famous ""Bahnhofstrasse""), attentive staff (they remember your name) and addicted to details. The atmosphere is classic and exclusive. The entry hall is wonderful, e.g. for taking coffee with a business contact or talking with friends. However the rooms are expensive, partially overpriced, e.g. a standard double room city-side 870 CHF (plus breakfast 50 CHF resp. 70 CHF full buffet) as you hear the street noise even when windows are closed, and the A/C on low level is as well not really quiet. If money doesn't matter, we recommend a lake-side Junior Suite (or Suite) - then you have probably the best option in town."
"Baur au Lac",,"Astonishing level of service in a grand European hotel","There's good, there's excellent, and there's amazing. The Baur au Lac is firmly in the amazing category. Now the bill is amazing too, but we've been hit with amazing bills in a number of establishments over the years and have never encountered such genuinely warm and cordial service from everyone on the staff, including the lady who picks up the laundry and the young man who turns the revolving door for you. Bed utterly comfortable, linen exquisite, room service punctual even when the hotel is full, bathrooms to top standard, location on the lake and one block from the high end of the high end shopping street ideal. Restaurant top-drawer. Our one complaint is the AC is definitely limited, but this is apparently due to Swiss laws related to energy conservation and so it is the"
"Baur au Lac",,"best luxury hotel I have stayed in!","it was the underfloor heating in the dressing room part of the bathroom in my junior suite that did it for me. Highly luxurious hotel, superb rooms, top quality everything. Insanely expensive. If you can get someone else to pay go for it! Not the kind of place I would want to stay in for personal travel :-)"
"Baur au Lac",,"Best hotel in Zürich","Best hotel in town, but you pay for it. Despite it is a big hotel, you don't feel it. The location is perfect; right in the beginning of Bahnhofstrasse. You always feel you are special there. The hotel's wine shop is a great place to buy delicious Swiss wines that you cannot find outside Switzerland."
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury and Quality for New Years","We spent the New Years Eve 2012-2013 in Baur au Lac. We stayed there for 4 days and 3 nights. The hotel was the place to be in New Years as it is right in front of the lake of Zurich where you have a clear view of the fireworks that the city organizes for New Years (Probably the best show ever (I have done New Years in Rio on Copa Cabana and nothing compares to the fireworks in Zurich)). The hotel is Top Quality! Very Spacious Rooms with great design and high standard bathrooms. Super clean! They come by at least 2 times a day to clean your room. Friendly staff. Breakfast room was very nice, with big windows and view of the garden and river. New Years dinner was also very good with gourmet dishes. Dance-floor was a bit empty (even thou they had live orchestra and singers) and we"
"Baur au Lac",,"One of the best hotels ever","This is my second review of this hotel. My views have changed so I decided to post again. This is probably one of my most favorite hotels. You get pure luxury and excellence. Especially with the new rooms this hotel is transformed one level higher. The rooms are very elegant and luxurious. The bathrooms are spacious and beautiful. The restaurant and food in general are great. The service is very good and everyone treats you with courtesy. The location is the best in Zurich. You get both bahnhofstrasse and the lake. In my opinion the best hotel in Zurich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Five star luxury in Zurich","This hotel epitomizes the legendary Swiss attention to detail and refined hospitality. It is the kind of experience which has one struggling to find a possible fault with anything and yet realize that the experience is truly faultless. As close to perfection as it can possibly get! Don't take my word for it, experience it for yourselves!"
"Baur au Lac",,"from a habitual user","Having been to Zurich on numerous occasions I have never hesitated in booking a room at the Baur au Lac. The place oozes charm, opulence and sophistication and is a delight, worth of a repeat visit. The breakfast is incredible, with views over the lake, it is a thoroughly enjoyable start to the day albeit very expensive - my only tip would be; don't order from the breakfast menu; the scrambled eggs are good but not worth selling a kidney for. If you time, take a tour of the area in the beautiful Rolls Royce that is usually parked outside; a perfect way to conclude a stay in one of the greats."
"Baur au Lac",,"Great Location","We liked the location right next to the lake and the fact that it is close to more or less everything one needs in downtown. Room was absolutely clean, renovated and had a comfortable size, separate walk-in closet and a well sized bathroom with daylight. Minibar and Wireless were included in the rate, staff was friendly and attentive (special thanks to the elderly Swiss doorman, excellent)."
"Baur au Lac",,"A Hotel that gets it right","This hotel was a lovely surprise. We booked it for one night after we flew into Switzerland and before we headed off on our road trip to Liechtenstein. The front of house staff were friendly and attentive. They learnt that we were on honeymoon and upgraded us to a lake view suite. The room was spacious and well appointed and the mini bar was complimentary. We were tired and a bit jet lagged and so ordered room service which was amazing. Great food of a standard you don't expect from room service. In the morning the garage attendants were quick to retrieve our car and offered us a choice of still or sparkling water to be placed in the car for the drive. It's the little things. We were so impressed we rebooked for another night at the conclusion of our road trip and our experience"
"Baur au Lac",,"Very stylish room!","Great service, stunning room and 2 mins walk to the lake. I love the decorations in the hotels room, very stylish and the bathroom is also groovy with a big bathtub. Delicious breakfast and great service!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Grand Hotellerie","An exquisite place to stay in Zürich! This is Grand Hotel! The rooms are splendidly appointed with wonderful pieces of antique furniture. Most comfortable beds invite for a good nights sleep. Attentive and competent service throughout the Hotel! Rive Gauche Bar is a great place for a nightcap."
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing Zurich experience!! You should definitely try it!!","The hotel is simply amazing! Perfect location (1 block from the main street, 3 blocks from the opera house), silent and really comfy rooms, incredible breakfast and discrete and very efficient service. I was gonna be in town for 2 days because it was my first stop for my wedding anniversary celebration, but what started as a stop over ended up as a gorgeous appetizer for our 15th honeymoon! The concierge was efficient even before I arrived, arranging a warm welcome at the airport at ou request and suggesting great restaurants and evening events. We chose an event at the opera house, and the concierge had our tickets and (a very conveniently located) restaurant reservation. The evening was perfect, and I am sure that the location and warmth of this hotel makes Zurich even more"
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent hotel and location","Situated at the head of Lake Zurich, the location is as fabulous as the rooms and service. Although perhaps premium priced, the luxuriousness of the rooms, wine and food, make this a special hotel. I was there for business and for pleasure and it was perfect for both types of stay. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and the breakfast, wine bar and room service are all very good indeed. Excellent, albeit small, gym with superb views of the lake. Thoroughly recommend this hotel, if your budget allows it."
"Baur au Lac",,"Great hotel , classic style of 5 stars","2 nights for bussines , great location near the banhof , the hotel is beutifull Mostnof it renovated but still save the classic style The service is amazing , all the time you can see people work all over and on everything, clean, concierge , porters The price is high never the less great luxury hotel Breakfest - amazing"
"Baur au Lac",,"Good location, food and service.","I have stayed at the Baur au Lac many times before usually on my own but this last visit with my husband. I like it mainly because of the excellent service, the beautiful public rooms, the relatively quiet location despite being in the city and the delicious food. I normally book a single room so this time having booked a double I expected something slightly larger but if anything it was smaller and felt a bit cramped. I always ask for a quiet room on a high floor with a nice view. The first two I got but as usual it was facing inwards, the so called ""courtyard view"" which just looks out on to the other rooms. We arrived too late for a ""Swiss"" lunch which normally ends promptly at 1.30pm but in this case 2pm so at about 2.20pm we made our way to the excellent Rive Gauche"
"Baur au Lac",,"Top of the world","Recently, guess some years ago, I saw the Baur au Lac mentioned as one of the best hotels of the world. Could´nt agree more.Got into Zurich after hours driving from Germany and arrived after midnight. Had no reservation for my plans had flunked. Checked in with the normal Swiss courtesy and they gave me a fantastic double room. The hotel is close to the Banhof Strasse, in the center of Zurich and, as the name says. on the brink of the Zugerzee.I made my comments before on Lausasse and on Switzerland. At 11 pm you won´nt find a single personon the streets. In the other bank, crossing the bridge, Zurich has an effort of nightlife, on the old part of the town. If I should recomend a place to stay (it´s expensive...) I woulkd point out the Baur au Lac. Has an excellent restaurant"
"Baur au Lac",,"What an excellent hotel","Baur au Lac Zürich is an extraordinary hotel in city center, at the end of the prestigious Bahnhofstrasse. Service is excellent, location is perfect, and this is truly a deluxe hotel with everything you can expect from this category in Switzerland. Breakfast buffet at “Pavillon” is just perfect! Very large choice and delicious food. With my best recommendation. I will stay here next time visiting Zürich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Incredible Baur Au Lac - Stunning!","We were thrilled with the wonderful wedding reception for our daughter and her husband - August 2012 at the gorgeous Baur Au Lac. All of our guests from Canada, USA, Switzerland and Dubai were incredibly impressed with this beautiful hotel. Thank you so much for the outstanding service that you provided to our family during the planning, as well as the actual day of the wedding reception at Baur Au Lac. Every guest said that it was the most beautiful wedding reception they had ever attended. The Baur Au Lac is a breath-taking setting. The hotel itself is stunning and from the moment we arrived everything was superb! The accomodation was beautiful and to be honest I have never experienced such a beautiful hotel suite. Our guests were thrilled with the elegant champagne"
"Baur au Lac",,"Favorite hotel in the world","I have 2 go to Europe several times a year for work and find the Zurich airport absolutely the easiest one to arrive to from America. Once I arrive there I go straight to the Baur Au Lac Hotel in Zurich. There are in reality many other hotels to go to in Zurich which are lesser in price. But for me the Baur Au Lac is the place 2 go . It is minutes away from the main shopping street, minutes away from the Train station and a very short walk to the old town. The Baur au lac was just recently renovated and the rooms are lovely and comfortable and for me very quiet. It is elegantly run, the service is meticulous. The restaurant in the Pavillion , which also was recently renovated, has the most beautiful atompshere which overlooks their gardens and the buffet for breakfast is great,"
"Baur au Lac",,"Finest Service in Zurich!!","This is the second time i stayed at this fantastic hotel. The rooms are very tastefully decorated and very comfortable, but what is incredible is the service and the courtesy of the staff. Almost every member calls you by name even on the first meeting!! AMAZING! Location is superb ofcourse though not may rooms have a great view! definitely the first choice for a hotel for business and pleasure stay in Zurich!!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Truly 5 star","The rooms are large and have heated floors in the bathrooms. Very clean and fully equipped. First class amenities. The shower spills gallons of water on you and there are more towels than you could ever use. The restaurant is on the same level is tour d'argent in Paris. Very pleased with the location, nearest hotel to the lake. Did not get a room with a lake view. Not necessary, however, I might try that next time. Black out drapes, in addition, automated plantation blinds that completely block all light."
"Baur au Lac",,"Fabulous one night stay","Our family stopped here for one night on our way back to the USA. I have to say everything was fantastic. We required transportation for six people from Basel to Zurich and then to the Zurich airport the following day. We had the same driver both days and he was phenomenal. He was friendly and assisted us all the way to check in at the airport on our way out of town. The rooms (two adjoining junior suites) were huge, immaculate, and beautiful. There was ample closet space, sitting space and huge bathrooms. The beds were extremely comfortable. The concierge made a wonderful restaurant reservation for us and was beyond helpful when it came to sharing directions, maps and the like. I will definitely return to this hotel and give it my highest recommendation. I have"
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury by the lake","Ok, giving 5 stars for a luxury hotel may be a common place, but I believe every hotel must be reviewed in to dimesions: An absolute dimension (using the Accor group as an example, a Sofitel will be a better experience than a Formule 1) and a relative dimension (again using the Accor group a Mercure may be better value than a Sofitel). That said, the Baur au Lac excells in both dimensions, you get everything you expect from a hotel on it class and price range, futhermore, you get impeccable services from start to end and top notch facilities in am incredible location. Firt location: It´s close enough to the main streets and sights so you will not need a car, but a quiet street, just by the lake and eith a private garden (of unbelieveble size for a building downtown) to have a"
"Baur au Lac",,"Magnificent Hotel","Stayed 2 nights at Baur au Lac, which was fantastic. Facilities & service were impeccable from start to finish. It is not just the quality of the furnishings, the ample size of the room (or bathroom), the bed (which was one of the best I have ever slept in) or the elegance of the dining room and bar area, but the little things - calling us when the room was ready (as we arrived 9:00 am) and having our bags all in the room, the door-man, the advice from the concierge etc. I have stayed many times in Zurich at a range of hotels - Baur au Lac is the best I have experienced by far."
"Baur au Lac",,"True luxury and tranquility by the lake","We stayed here for a week-end, the place is a real oasis in the city: great location, spectacular design and interiors, top-notch service and amenities. Our room and bathroom were unexpectedly spacious which is hard to find in European Hotels. Fruit, water and complimentary mini-bar were another pleasant surprise. The terrace adjunct to a lovely park is a place to be for drinks any time of the day, unfortunately they close at midnight which is a true pity, since the party just starts in the summer, and we wanted to stay there longer to enjoy fresh cool breeze from the lake. Pavillon restaurant is a special place to dine even if you are not staying at the hotel, the service, food and presentation are all simply perfect and won't disappoint you :)."
"Baur au Lac",,"Very good but slight room for improvement.","Zurich is probably the most expensive city in Europe - so if you are visiting then be prepared. We have been there before so knew what to expect - and this hotel is probably the best one there. Here you are paying for the peerless service, surroundings & location. The service is really old-school hotel - the staff are highly trained & professional. The dining options here are excellent - and sitting out in the terrace area looking onto the garden is a wonderful experience. The breakfasts in the restaurant are truly special - it is really a lovely place to sit & start the day. The only area I found a little lacking were the rooms. We had two - one of which had been allegedly recently renovated. My room was nice - if a little bland. And the tv/entertainment unti comes up for"
"Baur au Lac",,"More than 5 Stars","If I had more than 5 stars, this would probably be the only property to deserve it. I have been coming to Zurich every year for the past 18 years. Sometimes I have been in the city twice a year. Always it has been the Baur Au Lac. It is where i feel at home. The staff's attention to detail is exceptional legendary. Always courteous, friendly and always wanting to put the needs of their customers first. Their discretion is legendary and also is the concierge's wealth of knowledge.Ver Baur Au Lac can never fail. The food and rooms are superb. The hotel has an excellent location just seconds away from the shopping paradise of Banhofstrasse and the banking centre of Paradeplatz. The hotel is also minutes away from the beautiful Lake Zurich."
"Baur au Lac",,"Nothing Bad to Say","Baur Au Lac has excellent team; they always smile, helpful, warm and welcoming. They do their best to make our stay smooth and pleasant. It’s a pity they didn’t have badges with the names so I could thank them personally. The room was good, but a little noisy at night, I expected it to be calm because the hotel is surrounded with a nice green area, but our windows looked to the street. It’s nicely located very close to the shopping area and in the walking distance to the Zurich Lake."
"Baur au Lac",,"nice place","Stayed here many times over the years . Always top service , lots of atmosphere and good restaurants and bar . A jr suite facing the canal is prefferd , regular rooms are on the small side . Location is perfect , close to lake, shopping and business."
"Baur au Lac",,"Terrace Restaurant","What a dissapointment for the Spring to arrive and a chance to sit and enjoy lunch on the terrace of the renowned Baur au Lac hotel unfortunatley that as far as it goes , the service as always is excellant but the menu is very boring and does not seem to meet the requests of most of the guest, I thought after last year it would have gone from strength to strength but apparently not .Someone I suppose the chef has sat down and thought what can I do that suits me is quick ,convienient and sounds good well Sir you lost ,boring chicken with a broccoli crust and broccoli puree which part of your imagination did that come from . You have opportunity to make the terrace and its menu a sensation for the senses and the taste buds and you failed ,i hope some one takes note and can avert a"
"Baur au Lac",,"A little light lunch","A 3-hour perfect lunch in the Pavillon Restaurant with two business associates on a day visit to Zurich. This is not the place if you want a lively atmosphere - there were only 8 other diners - but you're not rushed, you can hear each other talk and the atmosphere is one of total calmness. Beautiful displays of flowers, too. The service is as you would expect. I arrived slightly before the others and was made to feel very welcome by a young waiter who engaged me in light-hearted conversation about shopping - oh - and I just loved the little stand that was brought for me to put my handbag on so that I didn't have to leave it on the floor - magic! Food was beautifully presented - chilled asparagus starter, turbot main course, raspberry tart for desert - light and fresh. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Fully meets expectations","Luxury, tradition, location - you get the best for the price that you pay for the room in this historic hotel. We were particularly impressed by the room design: the colours, the furniture, the marble in the bathroom, everything is very elegant and balanced. All the facilities are extremely well maintained, and the staff is very friendly and professional. I also recommend the Pavillion restaurant, we took the Harmonia menu with matching wines, and really enjoyed their traditional French cuisine, especially the vegetables that they served with the scallops and the beetroot sorbet that was presented as an intermission between the two main courses. Complaints? None. The only thing you should know is that their basic Deluxe rooms (and we took one) are not very spacious, you can't"
"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic hotel","I had a great stay here when in Zurich on business. This hotel really seems to do everything right -- the rooms are very elegant and comfortable, the staff is very attentive, and the location is great. Expensive but I would not hesitate to stay here again."
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing place to stay!","I was looking for someplace special to stay for this holiday to be a romantic getaway as well as a city break, a hotel with old-fashioned European grand hotel charm, and Baur au Lac turned out to be perfect! The decor, the look and feel of the hotel, the service and attitude of staff were all exceptional! Very good quality breakfast buffet with eggs/french toast/pancakes cooked to order and (again!) exceptional service in a beautiful dining room with views of garden and lake Zurich. Double room is good size with a very large bed, desk and coffee table with 2 chairs, lovely spacious bathroom: large bathtub, double sink, heated floor. We had a canal view room so with a balcony from the room and a window in the bathroom - lots of natural light! Location is great - right on the lake"
"Baur au Lac",,"Outstanding Concierge Staff","I stayed for my 6th wedding anniversary and the hotel was perfect for this kind of special occasion. The suite was very comfortable & functional. I have asked the concierge to arrange flowers and champagne before the arrival and they have done a great job. When my wife entered the suite, she was so impressed. The concierge staff from the door to the desk was just perfect. I was welcomed in French as I believe they recognize my car French plate… impressive! And all my requests were smoothly and effectively handled by all employees of the hotel who are polite and helpful. I will recommend this hotel for sure as it is also very well located downtown Zurich. CONGRATULATION"
"Baur au Lac",,"Everything you could expect from a classic Swiss hotel","If you can afford the price this hotel is an amazing experience. Perfectly located on the shore of the lake, Zurich's business district is small enough so that it's all in walking distance. My favourite moment was watching the concierge conduct 5 conversations in five minutes in flawless German, French, Italian and English switching effortlessly back and forth. Tey'll spoil you but the bill will be impressive."
"Baur au Lac",,"Best Five star Hotel In Zurich","It's Location is good. Inside decoration is awesome. Room is awesome. Real five star Hotel. One of the best hotel ever i saw. and also one of the best ever location i saw. But Rates of rooms is high but service is good, cleanliness of room is awesome . Outside location is good. When snowfall is having there garden is looking awesome."
"Baur au Lac",,"My Favorite hotel in the world!","This is a seeminly snobby hotel to those who have not stayed here. I have stayed at the Baur au Lac over 10 times and it has been a warm, friendly experience. The staff is so helpful! It feels like home every time I return. The rooms are beautiful and the showers feel as though you are standing under a waterfall! Worth every $ spent!! After all, you get what you pay for! One tip for the ladies... Bring hair conditioner... As in most european hotels, the hair products won't untangle your locks!"
"Baur au Lac",,"An absolute fortune, but welcome to Zurich!","At first I was a bit shocked at the rates here, but all of the top hotels in Zurich were around the same price, so I chose the Baur au Lac for the in-town location and more classic design. It was absolutely fantastic in every way. Our room was an unusual (almost round) shape and had a fabulous marble bathroom. The location of the hotel is very convenient for walking around to shops and restaurants. Service is exceptional, and at all times I felt like the staff to guest ratio was 5:1. Breakfast in the gorgeous dining room was top-notch. We loved dinner and drinks in the more causal of the two restaurant/bars, which has a very luxurious and sophisticated feel without being stuffy. Again, expect $20 drinks, but this comes with the territory in Zurich. If your budget allows,"
"Baur au Lac",,"The best hotel I have ever been","I think it is the best hotel I've ever been in the world . Friendly , kind stuffs ! Great location near the Zürich lake and famous street Banhofstraße with a lot of shops! There you can have an unforgettable relax , a lot of photos and excellent impression !!!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great located Hotel","Was staying here during December and had a large well presented room, very comfortable with modern bathroom. This hotel is centrally located and is within easy walking distance of the city centre and great shops! The room service is excellent and very fast. The concierge extremely helpful they were able to recommend and book restaurants and attractions. Loved the TV stations too, so many free stations. The only thing which wasn't so good was the doormen. They were rarely there and then were not very helpful, it was difficult entering and exiting with children and pushchairs without help."
"Baur au Lac",,"Amazing restaurant","The hotel has one of the finest restaurants I have eaten. Guide Michelin is owing them a star or two."
"Baur au Lac",,"Truly stupendous.","My favourite hotel in the world bar none. I cannot fault the staff or the building itself. I've been coming here since I was a teenager and would happily move in if I could. Every other hotel I have ever been to has at some stage irritated me - even if it has only been over something minor. The Baur au Lac has never done so. It is sublime. Stay here. Move here. I know I would."
"Baur au Lac",,"Epitome of Swiss Hospitality","There is something very special about this luxurious hotel. A feeling of familiar ambiance much like when arriving home. From staff greeting you at the door to reception and escort to your room, the experience is both friendly and respectful just in the right measure. The rooms, despite being, in some cases, at the end of a long corridor, are all up to date in every way and include complimentary wi fi and minibar not to mention fresh fruit and chocolates. The marble bathrooms are large and comfortable with walk in showers and there is more storage space in each room than one finds in many hotel suites. There is a quaint leftover from a previous era - outward opening doors into the corridor. The main restaurant, set in beautiful gardens with almost all glass walls is spectacular,"
"Baur au Lac",,"Classic Grand Hotel experience","Beautiful hotel close to Bahnhofstrasse and the lake. Very nice grounds and pavilion. Helpful and friendly service, especially from the team that serves breakfast. Great food. Beautiful and big rooms. The best pillows ever. Proper classic Grand Hotel, somehow old fashioned, but it is very relaxing. If you want something more happening and fun, then better stay in Dolder."
"Baur au Lac",,"the best hotel in Zurich - very classic","Baur au Lac is the most classic and best hotel in Zurich with a garden for the Summer, a Conservatory for chilly days and a great service; however not very young clientele around. Food in restaurant is amazing; amenities in bathroom could be better and smarter for such a stylish hotel...very much recommended place to be."
"Baur au Lac",,"Successful experience of old world elegance and modern design.","The location and energy of the hotel are enchanting. Suites on the canal have balconies and peekaboo views of Lake. Recently renovated rooms that are very generous in size the decor reminded me of the Firmdale Hotels in London. Like some of the other reviewers, I had the fantasy of moving into the hotel. As with most of Switzerland, it's an expensive experience for Americans. And, the hotel charges for many services like baggage handling and transfers."
"Baur au Lac",,"Wish I could have moved in.","First, let me say that I am a picky frequent traveller. My husband waits for the first complaint wherever we travel - and we travel alot. I have not one complaint about the Baur au Lac. Our room was magnificent, with a balcony overlooking the river on one side and a wall of mirrored closet doors on the other. The room was Architectural Digest in person. The all marble bath with balcony overlooking the river was stupendous. I will complain, we had only one short night there. Having stayed at the pleasant but modern Park Hyatt and a terrible Sheraton in Zurich, I will never again stay anywhere other than the Baur au Lac."
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent stay at Baur au Lac!","The staff was great and the location is very good. The room is beautiful, clean and very comfortable. Wish I had stayed a little longer in this luxurious hotel!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Discreet luxury hotel with world class prices.","There is no question that the Baur au Lac Exceeds all my standards for a top notch hotel. We stayed in an expansive suite which could also accurately be described as an expensive suite. Regardless, if you can overlook the prices, this hotel offers a great, understated luxury experience. While breakfast may not be included, it's definitely worth partaking. The location is good and staff attentive. "
"Baur au Lac",,"We loooovedd this hotel and its luxurious style","the hotel was absolutely beautiful - had sooo much character - the room we stayed in was huge and beautifully decorated - the bed was soo big and comfy and the bathroom was huge with great amenities. The hotel reflected absolute luxury in every way and took us back to an era of the past. Location was excellent as it is only few minutes from the beautiful zurich lake (hence the name of the hotel) and its only minutes to the famous banhoff strasse. Would definitely stay here again at all times."
"Baur au Lac",,"Baur au Lac = Below the Bar & Lacking","The Baur au Lac was very disappointing. I can only sum up the unpleasant service in a very trivial exchange that ultimately soured my entire stay. I made the mistake of assuming breakfast was included at the Baur au Lac. I suppose at $1,000 per night, one should not make that assumption, but in Europe you can. The Baur au Lac was the final two nights of a 10 day stay in Switzerland and Italy. Every other hotel stay included breakfast in the room rate. Regardless, after my yogurt, I was presented with a bill, $102 for two. I asked at the front desk, just to clarify, and indeed, breakfast was not included. I expressed some surprise, especially having just come from the Villa d’Este where no such charge occurred. The point is not the $100; I can pretend I had a"
"Baur au Lac",,"Lovely setting, questionable service standard","Met a friend for a drink in the lovely garden bar/restaurant. Ordered a glass of Chardonnay and was surprised to see this served already poured at the back of the house. For a 5 star hotel (and related prices) I would expect waiter to show me the bottle and pour the wine in front of me. I did not stay at the hotel and so cannot judge other aspects of the hotel."
"Baur au Lac",,"Don't Stay, Eat in the Garden","Well you can spot the odd rock or movie star (fresh from doing their banking down close-by Bahnhof Strasse), but the secret of the Baur Au Lac is the garden restaurant in Spring and Summer. A great, simple menu (try the Vitello Tonnato), lovely food, exceptional service, and nice wines by the glass or carafe, all for what you'll pay in some down market eatery elsewhere in the city. GO! it's the best deal in this wonderful bijou city. Except, of course my CHEAP hotel Hirschen, ten minutes walk away, where they have a great wine cellar (to drink in) and offer you nice things like umbrellas when the clouds arrive. Zurich used to be the most boring city in Europe, not any more - it's as cool as they come."
"Baur au Lac",,"the Hotel with style and elegance Zurich","I recently stayed in Zurich in this gem and historical hotel. A true Palace in terms of quality, service. The location of the hotel is extraordinary in the city next to the lake. The staff has a lots of attention to the guests, even if I do regret an expensive restaurant when we wanted something simple. The concierges are really full of attention and the restaurant is a real dream and peaceful in terms of design. 2 negative points the price of the breakfast and the ""duvets"" on the bed are too short. A must stay Hotel"
"Baur au Lac",,"After 40 years, Still the best","Considering its stature, this hotel gets rather few, and rather mixed reviews. My guess is that most of the guests have better things to do with their time than write reviews. The mixed reviews often seem to be the result of false expectations. Yes, the lobby, although beautifully refurbished, looks similar to what it did 40 years ago. Those looking for the grand and flashy should look elsewhere, perhaps one of those ubiquitous American chain hostels. I asked for the same room as last year. They said when I arrived that it had been refurbished. Yes, it is very nice, but I happened to like it better before.............but maybe I'm old fashioned; its always a matter of personal taste. Service at all levels is top notch. Room service is prompt, well executed and with a proper"
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful hotel horrible bed","On my second trip to Zurich I opted for the Baur au Lac after reading such terrific reviews. The common areas are quite sophisticated and classically elegant. The service at 500 chf a night for a single room was average. The bed was as if sleeping on a futon and the mattress was maybe two feet off the floor. Extremely uncomfortable sleep due to lousy soft lumpy mattress. No spa on premises. Doorman service could have been more present"
"Baur au Lac",,"One of the best in Zurich","It was my first time at baur au lac. My general impression of the lobby and hallways was that it looked too old-fashioned and needed a refurbishment. I hoped that the rooms would be nicer but I was a Little disappointed. The rooms on the website look much nicer and not all rooms have been refurbished yet. I had a junior suite and the tv's are ridiculously small for such a big sized room. Nevertheless overall it is one of the best hotels to stay in Zurich. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Fine hotel -- not necessarily the best location in town","Very little to fault here. The junior suite room facing the canal was lovely and so was the bathroom. Amenities were very nice. Gym and the business center with complimentary use of PC's both very good. Concierge and staff were fine. TV had every channel you could want off a satellite. Breakfast I was not tempted to have. Really nothing to not like about this place, and that's what it should be at that price. A lakeside room is overrated because hardly of the rooms are really close to the lake anyway. My only beef here is the location; I prefer the Widder as it is just closer down the street to the center. Here you have to walk an extra 5-10 minutes to get to the center of things toward the railroad station and the department stores. The Park Hyatt is 2 blocks away from this"
"Baur au Lac",,"stay at baur au lac, zurich","in the five star league, zurich's choice is quite distinct: dolder out of the city on the hill with nice views, widder in the pedestrian area and hyatt & baur au lac. hyatt is modern and trendy, baur au lac is old school and trendy. perfectly located at the lake end, it offers a spectacular park. unfortunately they have neverending renovations, so check if you have to stay next to a sledge hammer. service is good and some events are legendary: during streetparade and the summer party."
"Baur au Lac",,"Perfection.","I am not a great fan of hotels -- the older I get the worse they get. (Or is it my perception?) But here's a hotel where I could, quite happily, move in. We had an awful flight to Zurich on Air France -- missed our impossible connection in De Gaulle 2, which must be the most passenger-unfriendly terminal on earth. We were tired and grumpy when we arrived in Zurich. Imagine our delight to find the gentleman from the Baur au Lac waiting for us in the luggage claim area (airside of Swiss Customs) with our bags on a cart! He walked us to a clean and comfortable BMW and then whisked us, with quiet efficiency, to the hotel. Twenty-five minutes from luggage carousel to hotel front desk. We'd stayed at the Baur au Lac once before and loved it so much that we took photographs of"
"Baur au Lac",,"Elegance, Luxury and Warmth across from the Lake","Just back from Zurich where I took our 10 year old daughter and 74 year old aunt for 4 days. We stayed at the Baur Au Lac, after looking into the Widder (too masculine) and the Kindli (we needed serious concierge help). The Baur Au Lac was ideal for us: * Hotel is just off the Bahnstrasse. We were close to everything, but didn't have the hustle and bustle of cars and people swooshing past. It fees like a petit park, which is what the property boasts. The hotel is just across the street from the Lake, so we could walk easily in the mornings. If you have deep pockets, you can get a room with a view. We did not, but our room was nice. * Our Double Room was comfortable for two. The decor is tailored feminine, thick drapes, high ceilings, internet, polished bar glasses,"
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful building, extremely rude management","Before coming here I had read reviews raving about the hotel itself and yet being less than impressed with management and the food. On the plus side, I did not find mold on my berries, as another guest did and the support staff is wonderful, not the least of which is one of the members of the concierge staff, Jeremy, who was excellent professionally and personally. However, I had a BLAST of rudeness from the General Manager that was surreal. Specifically, my confirmation listed items included in the rate, one of which was breakfast. On the first day I was presented with a bill and when I inquired of the reservations person, I was told it was not included. From there I was asked to present the written confirmation, which I did. At that juncture I had assumed that the issue"
"Baur au Lac",,"BAD VALUE FOR MONEY","For years I have been told that BAUR AU LAC is a must.... but unfortunately we found that the hotel is a great disappointment... even so it is clean, the staff friendly, THE HOTEL IS DISAPPOINTING. The corridors feel like being in an institution rather than in a 5* de Luxe Hotel... The Television is set in a way that you have to crank your head, the room itself which was recommended as one of their best was simply dull and with NO VIEW ... in a 5* de Luxe you expect more ...a WOW effect but not that you have to ask first to have a surplus bed removed which was still there from a previous guest. the only true pleasure is the Garden Lounge/Bar where one sits in comfort.... will the Hotel see us again... NO!!!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Excellent Hotel; Good Restaurant","Recently spent two nights in Zurich while on a family vacation (2 adults, 2 children). We had two conencting rooms. The hotel experience for the family was excellent. The staff were warm and friendly. Treats were sent up for the kids, each room had a bowl of fresh fruit along with complimentary use of the mini-bar. Both of our rooms were recently remodeled and were of the caliber befitting a five star hotel. The only surprising item were the bath amenities. The Baur Au Lac uses their own brand but we did not find them consistent with a five star experience. I would like to recognize the concierges. They were excellent. Friendly, accommodating and always on top of the little details. The only area of the hotel that I would question are the restaurants. Breakfast was"
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful Suite - Terrible Food, Many Little Shortcomings Cheapen Stay","We arrived into one of their best 2 bedroom corner suites, facing the Lake and river. It was newly remodeled and perfectly decorated with warm colors, soft fabrics, high gloss wood, mirrors, gold accents - a really lovely suite. In the grand hotels of Europe (scattered throughout the Continent), most of the best suites are on the first floor. This comes from a bygone era when the most important guests wanted to sashay down a grand staircase for all to see (only the lesser folks rode the elevator or huffed up the stairs to the top floors back then). I found the suite a little too partitioned and cramped in some corners but my wife loved it and said she could live there. The front door area and valet reminded us of an LA hotel with a bar/lounge with tall white drapes located"

"Baur au Lac",,"VERY RUDE F&B MANAGER","It was the second time I went to Baur au Lac and the F&B manager or director, a very young chap, was there again. Very very rude boy. The staff is also very slow, arrogant and they think that because you do not enter with a Bentley and a Louis Vuitton you do not have money and deserve a good service.. The cocktails were really, my wife ordered a Mojito and it was the worst she has had.. they did not bother to offer any drinks, any snacks, nothing.. when i tried to complain they laughed in my face and I am not joking I have also heard this from many people..."
"Baur au Lac",,"Great hotel - just wish we could have stayed a little longer","My wife and I stayed here as a stopover en-route to Lake Como. Unfortunately, we were held up in traffic throughout Belgium on the way and so we arrived very late at night. This meant room service rather than sampling the restaurant. Nevertheless, our meals were excellent and the service was more like private dining than simply room service. The room itself was extremely comfortable and we felt very refreshed in the morning for the next day of travelling. Breakfast in the Pavillion room was also very pleasant (despite the rain). All staff were very courteous and friendly enough. We'd have no hesitation in staying here again and we felt like we missed out having only stayed the one night."
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful Stay in Zurich","My wife and two kids ages 8 and 4 spent 6 nights at the Baur au Lac . The entire stay was fantastic. From the moment we arrived to the the momement we checked out we were treated wonderfully. Our flight arrived @ 8am from Atlanta and we were picked up by a driver sent by the hotel. The hotel allowed us to check in early, this was greatly appreciated by my wife and I since we had our kids with us and they were very tired after the 8+ hour flight. We stayed in a Jr. Suite overlooking the lake. It was very spacious and very clean. The beds were very comfortable and rooms very quiet. The hotel is also a very clean and elegant hotel. The staff are very nice and will work to accomodate all requests. The concierge was very helpful with the local area and excursions and also"
"Baur au Lac",,"The finest city hotel","I stayed here for 5 days in February. I arrived early from Luzern. The reception was friendly and efficient as always. I was given a beautiful canal side room in traditional style and an excellent bathroom including a wonderful large bath! Room service was always prompt and efficient. The hotel restaurant (The Pavilion) serves breakfast in one of the most beautiful rooms in Switzerland. Three dinners and one lunch at the restaurant were outstanding. Free internet access and mini bar are a plus. This hotel is not cheap but I remember from my first stay 40 years ago that the rates in Swiss Francs have only increased from 350CHF to 1,150CHF per night. Location is perfect; with a park and views over the lake and the main shopping street only a few minutes away by foot This would be"
"Baur au Lac",,"Lovely Hotel with great Staff","We stayed in September with our teenage son. Our rooms were lovely - very comfortable with large bathrooms. The bedrooms have great black out blinds, so the rooms are dark and any noise is reduced. My only disappointment was that out room was at the back of the hotel and looked out on a fairly busy nondescript street. At 820CHF a night it was disappointing. The hotel also gave our son a room on the same floor but miles way from us. His room looked out on a light well. It was fine but if you book 2 rooms you do expect that they will be near to each other. The concierge through and other staff were really fabulous. Very helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was served in a lovely room looking out onto the garden and was very nice. We also ate at the Rive Gauche restaurant one night and"
"Baur au Lac",,"Very sophisticated and we love, Love, Love the Baur au Lac","An amazing property, lovely little hotel, the staff were great and they offered impressive service. Housekeeping was unlike any housekeeping we have experienced in our travels around the world. I gave my trousers to be iron and wanted it back in 10 minutes.....and 10 minutes it was. Now that's a true example of service. One small elevator to access the floors but it felt like my OWN personal elevator. The room was spacious with large windows, social area and writing desk, perfect for the business traveller or leisurely jet setters. It reminded me of home. In addition, his and her's closet space......ideal for me with 10 pairs of shoes and loads of clothes for a two-night stay. The Club was for members and hotel guests only. We enjoyed that too. Not smoky, not crowded,"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great base to explore zurich","It was our first trip to Zurich! Beautiful city! The hotel location was perfect to explore Zurich and the regions. Public transport is very easy to navigate from the hotel. The hotel staff let it down. They were way too stuck up! It is a lovely hotel. Breakfast was enjoyable except despite it being summer and 30C + you are not permitted to wear shorts! The food in the restaurant was ok.....We ate at Michelin star restaurants so not really fair to compare. Even at those fine restaurants the staff were friendly. The room we had was spacious and clean. We did try the hotel nightclub but there are better places in Zurich to party. All in all it was an amazing trip but I wouldn't stay at this hotel again!"
"Baur au Lac",,"Not what I had expected!","Alright, where to even start... We booked this hotel hearing from friends that it was the best place to stay. We usually stay in 5 star hotels, so the expense was not something that bothered us. We arrived around 4pm and we had to wait 30 minutes for our room to be ready. We stayed in a Jr. Suite, before we had booked we recieved an email about construction that was going on and how room view facing the lake would be blocked. Upon getting this email, I started emailing the hotel to ensure we would have a room with some sort of view. When we entered the room it was totally outdated. I understand trying to make a hotel room look antique, but this room look just ran down. Sure enough, we had a room that was not facing any views, it was on the canal, with a huge crane blocking any"
"Baur au Lac",,"Lovin' by the lake","Being one of the oldest hotels in Zurich, Baur au Lac is just great. Right in the middle of the city, situated by the lake and close to the famous Bahnhofstrasse, it stands up to its reputation. Each and every one of the guest is a VIP for the staff. The hotel is privately owned, small with about 124 rooms, 2 restaurants and a lounge bar. They have a fitness facility on the top floor with the beautiful view of the lake. The hotel building is about 170 years old. The rooms have a good view as well, some overlooking the hotel gardens and the lake while others with the city view. The rooms are big, beds comfortable and elaborate bathrooms with free WiFi access. All the guests are welcomed with a plate of fruits and water, which are changed everyday. The staff at the hotel are"
"Baur au Lac",,"Great room and service","Great location, attentive service from the staffs. I e-mailed the hotel and booked the room with them directly, responses were replied promptly and efficiently. Our flight arrived in the morning, and they arranged early check in to get us in our room in the morning, which is a really nice touch, I really appreciate it. The building itself is nice and elegant, but part of it were under construction, it's a shame not being able to get the canal view room. The lobby is comfy but a bit small, and I can see some wear and tear in the lobby though. Room is very clean and spacious, and the marble bathroom is very nice. Soundproof of the room is very good, definitely exceeds my expectation on an old hotel like this. Everyone from the hotel is friendly and helpful. The concierge took care"
"Baur au Lac",,"Fantastic Service - One of my favorite European City Hotels","The Baur au Lac has got to be one of the best hotels that I stay at. The service is second to none, both in the hotel, and in the conference & banqueting department. I've stayed here a couple of nights every year for the past 15 years. It's just a great place. Yes, the staff can be a little snooty, but what do you expect. They aren't the most technologically advanced rooms, but anyone who is that advanced nowadays has wireless internet on a handheld device anyway! I particularly like the way that they've renovated the place over the past couple of years. (Although it does seem as though they've been renovating continuously for the past 5 years!) The rooms are all good, the Pavillion is excellent, and the Rive Gauche bar is relatively ""happening"", for a Zurich hotel bar."
"Baur au Lac",,"Elegance and Location made for a fantastic stay","I have to say, when we pulled up to the hotel, I had some doubts. It seemed a little quiet and I was concerned that it might be a bit stuffy. And I was travelling with my two teenaged sons, so I live in fear of stuffy!!!! Added to that, there was noticeable construction noise when we entered the lobby. There is a construction project which will last for the next year or so, and it is extensive!!! However, we were really charmed by the gentleman at the front desk. He couldn't have been more welcoming. We loved our junior suite, with its Colefax and Fowler fabrics. It looked and felt fresh and clean. The bath was in top shape with lovely hotel-branded amenities. And there was an extensive assortment of candies left for my sons, along with the free mini-bar, which was"
"Baur au Lac",,"I was not impressed especially it being one of the best hotels in the world","Prices are steep. Hotel is a little snobbish Next to the lake and at end of Banohstrasse street on the left No plasma TV in such a expensive hotel Airconditioners don't work . The rooms are hot but that was common in most of Switzerland. All windows in standard rooms face to other buildings. So need to keep blinds down at all times If you are a light sleeper you can hear noises from the road Pros Free minibar Wireless lan serviece Bathrooms are huge Proximity to Banohstrasse Taxi fare to station is about 13 Francs Taxifare to the airport is about 55-60 Francs"
"Baur au Lac",,"5 stars can be very noisy","The Baur au Lac is certainly a fine hotel. Attentive service, clean and spacious room, marbled bathroom. The concierge staff is very polite, although sometimes overburdened. Free internet, as well as complimentary minibar, are details that really make you feel pampered. I had the chance to try both restaurants, the ""Rive Gauche"" and ""Le Pavillon"", and definitely preferred the former: a casual atmosphere with cheaper - and tastier - food. But after a 4 nights stay, I've got a sense of deceptiveness. By the time of reservation, I was assured that despite of the renovation works (to be completed by summer 2009), the hotel would continue to offer quite rooms in the wing of the city area. Well, my room wasn't quiet at all. Traffic noise was pervasive, day and night. And to make"
"Baur au Lac",,"One of the Great CIty Hotels of the World","The Baur au Lac is truly one of the all time greats. I visited Zurich with my parents and before our trip we debated between staying at the Baur au Lac and the Widder. For those of you trying to make that decision now, I hope my review will point you in the right (and only, in my opinion!) direction. The Baur au Lac is a rare combination of historic European elegance, up-to-date, meticulously maintained, luxurious comfort, and discreet, superior service. Trust me, it's rare to find all of these attributes in one hotel! The hotel is located on the end of Bahnafstrasse, the main boulevard for upscale shopping and dining, and is just a stone's throw away from Lake Zurich. The neoclassical bar on the main floor feels like a throwback to another century with its rather"
"Baur au Lac",,"Resting on their laurels ...and boring!","This is meant to be Zurich's best hotel. Its not impressive. The rooms are either incredibly dated but with a view of the canal or refurbished (nothing wow - rather classic and standard) but with a view of the street! The dated rooms have bathrooms that ..well..should have been renovated 15 years ago. They charge a fortune for below par accomodation. The garden is the best thing the hotel has to offer. The breakfast room (again so very dated and stale!) serves a great breakfast and the concierge are bubbly and up to task. Check in staff although polite and very correct, lack any form of friendliness. The whole place is old and fuddy-duddy. Clients range from Russian oligarchs in Ferraris and Lamborginis to old actresses and prima donnas that no one would recognise today but who"
"Baur au Lac",,"Zurich's finest","Beautiful location at the end of the Bahnhofstrasse in a small garden by the lake. The hotel is in easy walking distance or a short tram ride from the cities best restaurants, shops and attractions. The rooms are large and all you would expect of a five star hotel but without being over the top. The hotel is well over a 100 years old and marries its history with all the mod cons you would expect. What sets the Baur Au Lac apart is its service, they manage to make you feel as if you are 'part of the family' even when you are travelling with two small children. Breakfast is wonderful but the restaurants suffer from the 'hotel mentality' at the other meal periods...however as mentioned there are some great restaurants and cafes closeby so this is not a problem. Having stayed at"
"Baur au Lac",,"very lovely","We unfortunately only stayed here one night during a layover in Zurich - but it was wonderful. The service was fantastic, the food was great and the room was beautiful. The location cannot be beat! We loved our stay and would return."
"Baur au Lac",,"Mixed experience","My wife and I stayed here shortly after New Years as part of the special deal offerred during the holiday period. The deal was supposed to include an upgrade if available, but none was offerred and this time, I just didn't have the energy to ask. The room was pleasant and smelled clean; and the bathroom was truly lovely with white marble and a fantastic shower and separate tub. I think the shower may have been my favorite part of the whole room! There was unfortunately an oil stain on the cloth headboard which I found distasteful and surprising for a hotel that has such a reputation and charges so much per night - and again, on this trip I just didn't have the energy to make a fuss. After checking in and exploring the room, my wife and I went strolling in Zurich and decided"
"Baur au Lac",,"Exquisite","As a frequent traveller, you end up noticing small nuances in luxury hotels. The Baur au Lac offers the kind of personal service that only a family-owned palace hotel can deliver. Everything, from the greeting on arrival till the drive back to the airport, was superb. The location is unbeatable, the room was very comfortable, the bathroom renovated and beautiful (with natural light, which is becoming rare), the service (reception, concierge, restaurants, housekeeping) outstanding and the view from the well equipped fitness room was extraordinary (directly facing the lake). The food in the restaurants was very good, but the breakfast buffet (very elegantly displayed in the main restaurant) could be a little more imaginative (e.g. home-made jams, locally sourced honey, etc.) "
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury, but in every sense serious about its business","Given that Baur au Lac attracts a certain type of clientele (high profile business travellers, rich Eastern Europeans and the standard international pack) I guess that one should expect snobbery and over attentiveness as a part of the package, together with completely outrageous prices for every single service provided. Got a ""newly renovated"" deluxe room on a high floor when asked for an upgrade and no doubt the room is nice and spacious, as is the marble bathroom. A big minus on the TV though, I mean when paying close to 1000 CHF/night one doesn't want to have a 20"" blurry, obsolete CRT screen (unless this is some kind of nostalgia trip courtesy of the hotel management). Very nice lounge area, with excellent and relaxed service and the restaurants are definitely worth"
"Baur au Lac",,"Wonderful luxury hotel on the lake in Zurich","We spent several days here prior to a skiing vacation in Gstaad just before Xmas. Zurich was full of people doing their last minute shopping and everything looked and felt very festive. The Baur au Lac is a wonderful place to stay in downtown Zurich. It is located just off the Bahnhofstrasse at the lake and is therefore central to everything. Overall, this is an excellent place to stay. We have stayed here numerous times and we keep coming back. Service is friendly and efficient. Internet is now free in the rooms as is the mini bar - small amenities that make a very positive impact. The Concierge, too, is friendly and efficient. The junior suite and double room we had were very nice. This is a more traditional hotel so the decor is not modern; but the bathrooms are excellent and"

"Baur au Lac",,"Terrific Stay at the Baur au Lac","At the end of a week-long visit to Germany and Austria, I booked a night at the Baur au Lac prior to our trip home. What a wonderful way to complete our vacation! The hotel is a grand property with friendly, attentive and impeccable service. Our lunch at the Pavillion restaurant was so terrific, we came back for seconds at dinner time (undoubtedly missing out on lots of other wonderful alternatives). The hotel is expensive but the fond memories more than make up for the cost. Highly recommended. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Great hotel, excellent location.","I stayed at the Baur au Lac for one night to attend a business meeting that was held in the hotel. The room was large, clean and well equipped, with a large bathroom, overlooking the river. The hotel has a great location, about 15 minutes walk from the main station and about 2 minutes from the lake. Service was good and unobtrusive and all staff we encountered spoke good english. The room provided for the meeting was nice and staff were attentive and helpfully put up signs to direct people to the meeting room without being asked. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Simply the Best","Having stayed at a fair number of the best hotels in the world, there is no doubt that the Baur au Lac is simply the best hotel in Europe, if not the world. The location is as central as can be; the garden is lovely; the views (if you have a lakeside room) are simply fabulous, and the rooms are extremely clean and well-maintained. However, what truly sets the Baur au Lac apart from other five star hotels is the staff. There are more impressive hotels and hotels with larger rooms and suites, but none has a staff as professional, dedicated and friendly as the Baur. It is truly magnificent and friendly, and the staff will do anything and everything to satisfy the demands of every guest. Yes, it is expensive. But not more so than other five star hotels. And for the price of a"
"Baur au Lac",,"Luxury on Christmas Eve","My wife and I had a 24 hour layover in Zurich on Christmas Eve, so what better place we thought to spend the day and evening than at this first class hotel. From the check in to the wonderful suite, to the first class staff everything about this hotel was top notch. The room had everything you needed, from a wonderful balcony to a huge bed, and lets not forget the heated bathroom floors. We were able to have breakfast before our early morning flight and it was simply amazing, we enjoyed it so much we made the taxi wait 10 more minutes so that we could savor every last minute that this hotel had to offer. If you are looking for luxury, attention to detail and a staff that can not do enough for you. The Baur Au Lac is your place. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Superb hotel in Zurich","My husband and I always wanted to stay here and finally we did. It was a splurge but well worth it. We found everything about the hotel--decor, location, cleanliness, comfort and staff attitude--to be superb. The initial room they offered us faced the street. It was quite large. We wanted an inner courtyard room for the quiet and although the room was quiet, it was also very small. But the room was stunning (recently redone) and the bathroom phenomenal. Best hotel shower experience ever. Also, the size of the marble slabs (no seams except at the corners) was impressive. Sheets were very soft. The breakfast is not to be missed. It was the best breakfast we have ever had in Zurich and we've had some good ones. Also, one of the hotels' restaurants, Rive Gauche, is"
"Baur au Lac",,"The best city hotel in Europe","The impeccable service distinguishes this great hotel. Call for anything, food, cleaning, then race to your room door to beat the knock by the service staff. And breakfast is the place to be in Zurich in the morning, especially during the summer. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Overrated","My daughter and I stayed at the Baur au Lac on the 22 & 23.8.06. The price of CHF 740.00 per night for a Deluxe Room is far too much for a 5x4 M. room - even in Zurich. The tiny balcony overlooking the ""Schanzengraben"" canal is dangerous; the top of the railing is far too low. Had my daughter been younger, I could not of left her alone. Also the pink (!!) tiled bathroom is not to everybody's taste. The water pipes in the bath cum shower stick out of the wall and you have to watch out to not keep burning yourself on the hot one. Also the two 1 M. wide beds were much too soft - more like a trampoline. The newspaper which I ordered was charged to my bill (CHF 2.50), my car was parked in their garage at CHF 35.00 / day and the mediocre breakfast cost CHF 42.00. My conclusion:"
"Baur au Lac",,"Fabulous Swiss perfection...and the little dog loved it too!","My husband and I, AND our little pet Pomeranian stayed in a junior suite at this fabulous hotel for my 49th birthday. We chose the hotel based on previous reviews, the Conde Nast reputation and the fact that it was a dog-friendly hotel. We paid a very nominal surcharge for the dog. Otherwise, we chose a very affordable package from the hotel website. It included free upgrade to a junior suite, a bottle of champagne, free use of the spa (which we never availed ourselves of, unfortunately) and late checkout. Check-in was professional, courteous and very quick. We were then taken to our LOVELY junior suite on the top floor. The suite itself was extremely spacious, beautifully furnished with traditional drape swags, a stunning choice of fabrics and a great bed. The all-marble"
"Baur au Lac",,"Worth Every Penny (dollar)","Loved our stay here in mid-September! We were celebrating our tenth anniversary, and arrived having spent two weeks hiking the Bernese Oberland the the Lower Engadine valley. We booked a junior suite with balcony/view of the lake and it was superb! Close to $1000 for the one night ( but it was worth it to finish a fabulous trip in style.) I cannot say enough about the room, the service, the amenities. I would definitely stay here again. Gay friendly, as is most of Switzerland. "
"Baur au Lac",,"Best of the best","This is a prime example of ""you get what you pay for."" The prices are certainly at the high end of the scale for Zurich's hotels, but your stay here will be worth every cent. From the moment one arrives in the hotel's small courtyard and is met by the courteous doorman, the Baur au Lac starts to show it's class. The reception personnel handles your check-in briskly and you are escorted to your room in a very gracious and efficient manner. Rooms have both exterior and courtyard views - you should definitely specify your preference at this hotel. The concierge staff, certainly among the best in Zurich, is able to juggle and expertly handle any request you might have. The hotel puts on a delicious buffet breakfast served in the hotel's elegant dining room (probably some of"
"Baur au Lac",,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","I stayed at the Baur au Lac over the Christmas holiday in 2004. The hotel was beautifully decorated with a huge tree just off the lobby in the lounge. This was my first trip to Zurich and I found the location of the hotel to be perfectly situated. You were able to walk just about anywhere with ease. The world famous Bahnhofstrasse was just half a block away. Needless to say, the shops were simply amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed strolling up and down the street every day. I visited the Swiss National Museum which I found to be very interesting and would definitely recommend it. I made sure to make reservations for both the Christmas Eve dinner and the Christmas Day brunch which the hotel had prepared for its guests. I had the most scrumptious turkey dinner I’ve ever had"
"Baur au Lac",,"Grand formality","My wife and I enjoyed this lovely grand hotel, but were disappointed that the promised lake view was marginal and distant. The staff is polite and formal. Where some might find the old-world atmosphere ""stuffy"", others would rate it ""polished"". The restaurants are excellent, since the hotel has both a formal restaurant (outdoors in summer) and an infomal restaurant. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. ""Captains of industry"" and royalty both feel comforatble here."
"Baur au Lac",,"nice but too expensive","We recently visited the hotel and were recommended to request the junior suite because of it's view of the lake. I felt the view was poor, we were overlooking roof tops and I requested another room due to my dissatisfaction. I was then moved to another (less expensive room) which was very beautiful."
